"b'Trump Blasts U.S. Anchor Baby Policy: \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re Violating Something Very Sacred, You\xe2\x80\x99re Violating a Border\xe2\x80\x99'",http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/04/06/trump-blasts-u-s-anchor-baby-policy-youre-violating-something-very-sacred-youre-violating-a-border/,"During a roundtable discussion in West Virginia, Trump slammed the birthright citizenship policy — illegal aliens’ children are commonly referred to as “anchor babies” — noting that fellow Western nations do not have such a policy.Trump said:If you have a baby on our land, congratulations. That baby is a United States citizen. We’re the only one. Now Mexico has very tough policies. They can do whatever they want, which is the way it should be. You’re violating something very sacred. You’re violating a border. [Emphasis added]As Breitbart News reported, there are 4.5 million anchor babies in the U.S. under the age of 18-years-old. This estimate does not include the potentially millions of anchor babies who are older than 18-years-old.The 4.5 million anchor babies estimate exceeds the four million American children born every year. In the next decade, the CBO estimates that there will be at least another 600,000 anchor babies born in the U.S., which would put the anchor baby population on track to exceed annual American births — should the U.S. birth rate not increase — by more than one million anchor babies.The birthright citizenship debate was not always partisan, as it currently is, with establishment Republicans and Democrats supporting anchor babies.Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) once opposed birthright citizenship, saying in 1993 that “no sane country” would reward illegal aliens with U.S. citizenship for their children.Proponents of birthright citizenship often claim the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires the policy. The Supreme Court, however, has never explicitly ruled that the children of illegal aliens must be granted automatic citizenship and many legal scholars dispute the idea.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"b'\xe2\x80\x98Zero Tolerance\xe2\x80\x99 for Illegals, Says Jeff Sessions'",http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/04/06/zero-tolerance-jeff-sessions-issues-new-memo-forbidding-leniency-at-the-border/,"The memo for Sessions’ office calls on U.S. attorneys on the Southwest Border to adopt a ‘zero-tolerance’ policy to prosecute every alleged border jumpers sent to them by the Department of Homeland Security.This policy ends the commonplace practice of simply returning border-crossers to Mexico or their own country, and it creates a huge economic risk for the poor young migrants seeking low-wage jobs in the United States. If caught, they will lose several months or even years of much-needed earnings while they sit in a U.S. jail, so creating more economic problems for their families and also angering the coyotes who expect the migrants to pay off their smuggling costs.Pro-American immigration reformers welcomed the decision.“The attorney general’s zero-tolerance approach is a welcome and needed change after too many years of catch-and-release policy,” said Dale Wilcox, director of the Immigration Reform Law Institute. “When the federal government’s voice on illegal immigration is firm and backed with consistent actions, the result will be less illegal border crossings and safer communities.”The statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1325(a), specifies a misdemeanor sentence up to six months for a first-time illegal entry and a felony penalty of up to two years for subsequent offenses.“This zero tolerance policy shall supersede any existing policies,” Session said in a Friday press release, referencing the GOP-controlled Congress which failed to pass reforms or provide funds for President Donald Trump’s signature border wall. He continued:The situation at our Southwest Border is unacceptable. Congress has failed to pass effective legislation that serves the national interest—that closes dangerous loopholes and fully funds a wall along our southern border. As a result, a crisis has erupted at our Southwest Border that necessitates an escalated effort to prosecute those who choose to illegally cross our border.Arrests on the border, after plummeting last year as President Trump took office, appear to have shot back up. Perhaps most illustrative of the challenges faced was the audacity of leftist non-profits sponsoring a “caravan” of more that 1,000 Central American migrants to walk through Mexico and take advantage of America’s asylum laws. Political pressure convinced Mexico to break the caravan up before it reached the American border.The memo is the fulfillment of an effort that began last April when Sessions issued the first set of new prosecution guidelines to end what he called then “catch-and-release” policies. At the time, DoJ recommend prosecuting all repeat illegal entry offenders, but Friday’s memo goes further and returns to President George W. Bush’s limited policy of “Operation Streamline.”Project Streamline was used in certain border districts until the Obama administration suspended the program under pressure from open-borders Republican Sens. Jeff Flake and John McCain (R-AZ) in 2015. Sessions specifically referenced the success of Operation Streamline in his new memo.The Attorney General issued the following warning:To those who wish to challenge the Trump Administration’s commitment to public safety, national security, and the rule of law, I warn you: illegally entering this country will not be rewarded, but will instead be met with the full prosecutorial powers of the Department of Justice. To the Department’s prosecutors, I urge you: promoting and enforcing the rule of law is vital to protecting a nation, its borders, and its citizens. You play a critical part in fulfilling these goals, and I thank you for your continued efforts in seeing to it that our laws—and as a result, our nation—are respected.The new memo comes as a broad administration push on border security is underway. Somewhere between two and four thousand National Guardsmen are slated to be sent to the border to reinforce the U.S. Border Patrol in its mission.Meanwhile, the immigration courts, under Attorney General Sessions authority as part of the Justice Departments Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR), have increased their rate of deportation proceedings to the levels that prevailed before the Obama years."
b'Poll: Working-Class Americans Most Supportive of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s Immigration Agenda Thus Far',http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/04/06/poll-working-class-americans-most-supportive-of-trumps-immigration-agenda-thus-far/,"A new Rasmussen Reports poll reveals that a majority of Americans earning between $30,000 to $50,000 a year say Trump is doing a good or excellent job on the issue of immigration a year and a few months into his presidency.Meanwhile, only 40 percent of working and middle-class Americans said Trump was doing a “poor” job on the immigration issue.The least supportive of Trump’s immigration agenda so far are wealthy Americans, who profit from a never-ending flow of mass immigration whereby the U.S. admits more than 1.5 million illegal and legal immigrants every year.Among Americans earning $200,000 a year, nearly 60 percent said they believed Trump was doing a bad job on immigration. Only 30 percent of wealthy Americans said they thought Trump’s immigration agenda thus far was “excellent” or “good.”Trump has yet to secure funding and full construction of a border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, despite it being his biggest campaign promise. Meanwhile, border-crossings have surged back to Obama-era levels and are expected to be overwhelmingly high this year if a wall is not built.Spending Bill: Trump Banned from Building Border Wall with Prototypes He Toured in San Diegohttps://t.co/ZQFuQC4j96— John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) March 23, 2018Meanwhile, Americans’ wages — which were on the rise months ago — have slowed down as illegal immigration continues as usual and ICE is not given any more manpower than they had a year ago to deport illegal aliens living in the interior of the country.In the first couple of months of 2018, Trump’s tight labor market, through increased immigration enforcement, yielded history-making wage growth for American workers in the construction industry, the garment industry, for workers employed at small businesses, and black Americans.Likewise, in Fiscal Year 2018 so far, more than 13,000 “unaccompanied minor” border-crossers have been resettled throughout the U.S., as Breitbart News reported.Currently, the U.S. admits more than 1.5 million legal and illegal immigrants every year, with more than 70 percent coming to the country through the process known as “chain migration,” whereby naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S. In the next 20 years, the current U.S. legal immigration system is on track to import roughly 15 million new foreign-born voters. Between seven and eight million of those foreign-born voters will arrive in the U.S. through chain migration.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder. "
b'Top Banker Wants More Cheap White-Collar Immigrants',http://www.breitbart.com/immigration/2018/04/06/top-banker-wants-more-cheap-white-collar-immigration/,"Chairman Jamie Dimon’s call for more white-collar skilled immigration comes as U.S. companies rush to use the government’s offer of 85,000 H-1B visas which allow foreign college graduates to work in the U.S. for at least three years. When the H-1B is combined with various other visa-worker programs, more than 1 million college-grad guest workers are already holding U.S. jobs — and cutting salaries for American graduates.“Those who get an advanced degree in the United States should receive a green card along with their diploma,” Dimon said in his annual letter to investors. “We need these skilled individuals in America.”“Forty percent of foreign students who receive advanced degrees in science, technology and math (300,000 students annually) have no legal way of staying here, although many would choose to do so,” he said in the April 5 letter. “Most students from countries outside the United States pay full freight to attend our universities but many are forced to take the training back home.”Dimon is an investor, not an employee, so he makes more money by expanding the size of the economy and growing values on Wall Street, almost regardless of employees’ per-capita wages and salaries.JPMorgan is already a huge user of the H-1B program and has requested roughly 6,000 H-1B visas since 2014.Democrat leader on Wall St asks CEOs to work with unions to raise wages, so preserving ""workers’ confidence in the economic system."" But Rubin opposes immigration reform to raise wages via a tight labor market. That's bad for Wall Street (and the party). https://t.co/mHz9ZzVoSG— Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 6, 2018Dimon caveated his call for cheaper labor by focusing on people with “advanced degrees in science, technology and math.”But that caveat means little for American graduates because most skilled degrees include at least one of these subjects, such as statistics in a business degree and medical biology in a healthcare degrees. The federal government already lists a very wide variety of white-collar and skilled blue-collar jobs which can be won by foreign college graduate via the “Optional Practical Training” program. The list includes:dairy science… horticultural science…  environmental studies … natural resources conservation … urban forestry … artificial intelligence … computer graphics … solar energy … naval science … cyber/electronic operations and warfare … nutrition sciences … sustainability studies … child psychology … archaeology … medical science … veterinary physiology … business statistics … management science.Dimon’s call for more and cheaper white-collar labor is echoed by other business groups, including FWD.us, a lobby for information-technology investors.In 2013, the Senate’s “Gang of Eight” immigration-and-amnesty bill included a section allowing universities to get green cards for all of their foreign customers. If the measure had passed, the white-collar labor market would have been flooded with a potentially unlimited supply of foreign college-grad seeking to work and living in the United States. That oversupply would have cut salaries for millions of young Americans graduates who need to pay their college debts, get married, buy houses and support children.But it was opposition from voters — amid near-universal support in the established media — which killed the cheap white-collar labor provision and the amnesty bill. That opposition was recognized by New York real-estate investor Donald Trump, who used it to win the White House in 2016.University groups strongly support the proposal to give their customers the hugely valuable bonus of green cards and citizenship. If made law, it would effectively allow academics and administrators — and the owners of private universities — to pocket the proceeds from selling the hugely valuable prize of Americans’ citizenship.Four million Americans turn 18 each year and begin looking for good jobs in the free market.But the federal government inflates the supply of new labor by annually accepting roughly 1.1 million new legal immigrants, by providing work-permits to roughly 3 million resident foreigners, and by doing little to block the employment of roughly 8 million illegal immigrants.The Washington-imposed economic policy of economic growth via mass-immigration shifts wealth from young people towards older people, it floods the market with foreign labor, spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids’ schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.     "

I mean, the less exports we have the less imports we have and that makes us worse off. And the more we isolate ourselves, the less we learn of improvements and developments and innovations around the world.…We’re working hard against all these other protectionist trade barriers that are just different forms of corporate welfare which, other than a few special interests, will make Americans worse off.In the last year, the Koch brothers have been on a campaign against Trump’s trade and immigration agenda, both designed to increase U.S. manufacturing and increase wages for American workers.Like immigration, though, the Koch brothers remain out of touch with Republican voters and the majority of Americans on the issue of trade.For example, the most recent Morning Consult poll revealed that nearly 60 percent of Americans say tariffs on imported Chinese steel and aluminum were necessary for the U.S.-China economic relationship.Unlike Trump and his base of supporters, the Koch brothers prefer the Washington, DC,-imposed cheap labor, free trade economic model wherein American workers’ wages remain stagnant and foreign products continue to flow into the country.That economic model relies on more than 1.5 million illegal and legal immigrants being admitted to the U.S. every year, driving down Americans’ wages, and corporations moving their manufacturing and production overseas only to export their cheap products back into the country.This week, the Trump administration announced $50 billion worth of tariffs and restrictions it will impose on imported products from China, Breitbart News‘s John Carney reported.Meanwhile, free trade with China has resulted in the elimination of millions of American jobs. For example, in a report by the Economic Policy Institute, between 2001 and 2015, about 3.4 million U.S. jobs were lost due to the country’s trade deficit with China.Of the 3.4 million U.S. jobs lost in that time period, about 2.6 million were lost in the crippled manufacturing industry, making up about three-fourths of the loss of jobs from the U.S.-Chinese trade deficit.The AtlasThe Rust Belt has been one of the hardest regions hit because of U.S. free trade with Mexico. In total, about 700,000 U.S. workers have been displaced, including:Meanwhile, since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) took effect in the 1990s, at least one million net U.S. jobs have been lost because of the free trade deal. Between 2000 and 2014, there have been about five million manufacturing jobs lost across the country as trade deficits continue soaring.One former steel town in West Virginia lost 94 percent of its steel jobs because of NAFTA, with nearly 10,000 workers in the town being displaced from the steel industry.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Wallace added that there is clearly bias in the mainstream media.Wallace said, “Well look, I think there are two things that are going on here, and I think they can both be true. I think that the president has been engaged in — and I’ve said this before — in an unprecedented attack on the media. As a member of the media, maybe not a member of the mainstream media, but a member of the media, and I’ve been doing this for almost half a century, it bothers me. I was particularly distressed, I have to say, when the president held that joint news conference with the three presidents of the Baltic nations, and — you know, it’s one thing when we fight amongst ourselves, it’s a different thing when it’s on the international stage — talked about the fake media. You know, I’ve never heard a president bash the media when it’s on — when he’s dealing with foreign leaders.”He added, “On the other hand, do I think that there is bias among members of the mainstream media? Absolutely. You can see it on the front pages of some newspapers. You can see it on the lead on some of the newscasts that — or so-called newscasts of some of our competitors. So, I think both of those things are true. And I’m not sure that it’s especially healthy for the country.”Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"

The suit contained no allegations of inappropriate sexual contact and is entirely concerned with jokes and insults Farenthold allegedly made.Michael Rekola, a former male staffer, claimed on CNN that Farenthold’s lewd jokes were serious enough for him to go to the House Ethics Committee and forced him to “seek medical treatment and psychological counseling, and at one point, caused him to vomit daily.”“I just want to let everyone know, I absolutely did not engage in any improper conduct. I was investigated by the office of congressional ethics, and they found 6-0, there wasn’t enough effort,” Farenthold told his constituents via Skype call when he decided not to run again in December.At that time, Farenthold was under heavy pressure after it was revealed he had settled a 2014 lawsuit by former communications director Lauren Greene, using around $84,000 of taxpayer money. She had alleged “gender discrimination,” “sexual harassment,” and “creating a hostile work environment.” This was at the rough peak of public exposure for the “#MeToo” movement affecting powerful men in several industries and branches of government.What exactly led Farenthold to expedite his departure is not clear.Farenthold has generally voted as a conservative and been broadly supportive of President Donald Trump. He is alleged in the sexual harassment lawsuit and, on the basis of his sometimes eccentric behavior – such as challenging fellow Republicans to duel him – to have problems with alcohol."

Strampel, who was arrested during an investigation into his handling of child sex abuse complaints against Dr. Larry Nassar, faces fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct charges.A university document including notes from Strampel’s personnel file reveals a trend of disturbing behavior.“Dean Strampel should not interject sex into every conversation with staff and students,” one commenter wrote. “As a female faculty (member), an argument may be made that I could have the possibility of being treated better than my male counterparts, especially if I have a pretty face and a curvaceous figure, well-dressed in short skirts and low-cut tops,” another stated.“I have witnessed unprofessional and sexual comments from the dean about female students – including remarks from the dean of a female wearing ‘come (expletive) me heels’ and another instance where he admitt(ed) to knowing a student for a long period and how ‘she certainly filled out nicely,'” another read.Documents from the investigation into Strampel revealed that the university was likely aware of his unprofessional conduct. The Detroit News published an editorial this week entitled “MSU knowingly kept a predator on payroll.”“The excerpts from Dr. William Strampel’s performance review raise a critical question: What’s it take to get fired from Michigan State University? ” the editorial began.In a 2010 document, Michigan State Provost Kim Wilcox endorsed Strampel in his role as dean despite concerns over his conduct. “Our several discussions over the past several months have reinforced my commitment and that of Dean Strampel to advancing the goals of the College within the broad mission of Michigan State University,” Wilcox wrote.Strampel’s arrest comes in the middle of an investigation into Michigan State University’s mishandling of child sex abuse allegations against Dr. Larry Nassar."

His next court date was set for June 14.“He’s the most visible face on the planet. He has no criminal history and the bail package is completely appropriate,” McGregor’s lawyer Jim Walden told the court.UFC President Dana White told ESPN that no decision would be taken on McGregor’s lucrative UFC career until after this weekend’s fight card, and denied that Thursday’s fracas had been an elaborate publicity stunt.“Conor is in a lot of trouble. Obviously, the big question everybody’s been asking me is, ‘Are you firing Conor McGregor?'” White told the broadcaster. “This is bigger than Conor McGregor getting fired. There are so many more moving pieces to this thing.”– ‘Most disgusting thing ever’ –“This is the last stunt on Earth that we’d ever pull,” he said. “This is embarrassing for the sport and obviously for the UFC.”McGregor was charged with three counts of assault and one count of criminal mischief.

U.S. citizens and firms are prohibited from carrying out any business with individuals in the lists. According to the allegations, narco-music promoter Jesus “Chucho Perez” Perez Alvear laundered money for Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacíon and Los Cuinis. Venezuelan-Italian fashion photographer Miguel Jose Leone Martinez stands accused of running an international prostitution ring tied to Los Cuinis as well. The man known as “Chucho Perez” is believed to launder drug proceeds through narco-music concerts in Mexico. Perez is considered to be a close ally of the leadership of Los Cuinis and the CJNG. Through his business, Gallistica Diamante (AKA Ticket Premier), Perez holds concerts in town fairs and events and is known to use violence to get the concession sales. He allegedly commingles the cartel’s money with his own for laundering purposes. One of the musicians that Perez does business with is Julio Cesar “Julion Alvarez” Alvarez Montelongo. As Breitbart Texas reported, Julion Alvarez was singled out by Treasury officials and added to the kingpin list for his business dealings with another cartel that is an ally of CJNG and Los Cuinis. Alvarez became an embarrassment for Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, who was caught deleting a social media post of the two men riding in a boat shortly after the U.S. announced Alvarez was a wanted kingpin. Leone Martinez is a known associate of Perez, who authorities claim uses his role as a fashion photographer to recruit models and beauty pageant contestants from Europe and South America to become prostitutes for Los Cuinis. “Treasury is targeting individuals who work on behalf of violent Mexican drug kingpins, and support their opulent lifestyles by trafficking deadly drugs into the United States,” said Sigal Mandelker, Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence in a prepared statement.  “Our designation of Jesus Perez Alvear exposes his role helping CJNG and Los Cuinis exploit the Mexican music industry to launder drug proceeds and glorify their criminal activities.  We are targeting fashion photographer Miguel Jose Leone who leads an international prostitution ring that recruits models and beauty pageant contestants from South America and Europe into prostitution for senior members of the Los Cuinis DTO.”  Ildefonso Ortiz is an award-winning journalist with Breitbart Texas.

"b'Trump: Up to 4,000 National Guard to the Border'",http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/04/05/trump-up-4000-national-guard-to-border/,"“We’re looking from 2,000 to 4,000” on the border, Trump told reporters during a gaggle on Air Force One.  “We’ll probably keep them, or a large portion of them, until such time as we get the wall.”Trump is mobilizing the National Guard via Title 32 of federal law, which requires cooperation and approval from the governors. The soldiers will be used for support roles, such as logistics and surveillance, as many Central American economic migrants use spring and summer migrate to the U.S. border, either to sneak through or to request asylum.Trump’s deployment may be smaller than President George W. Bush’s mobilization of up to 6,000 soldiers for support roles under “Operation Jump Start.”According to a 2008 report by the National Guard:Operation Jump Start is a two-year program. The National Guard’s initial commitment called for up to 6,000 troops during the first year. During the second year troop strength decreased incrementally from approx. 6,000 to 3,000 troops as new Border Patrol agents were trained, new infrastructure was built, and advanced technologies were implemented in border security. Operation Jump Start is scheduled to end July 15, 2008.The statement continued:More than 29,000 troops from all 54 states and territories have supported Operation Jump Start since the mission began in 2006.Projected mission cost is $1.2B. $211M spent in FY 06, $687M spent in FY 07. $304M budgeted for FY 08 …Improvements in Tactical Infrastructure Include:• 31+ Miles of Fencing• 13+ Miles of Road• 86+ Miles of Vehicle Border Barriers• 1153 Miles of Road RepairedTrump is being forced to deploy the National Guard because Democrats — and business-first Republicans — blocked his immigration reforms plan in a February 15 vote. Trump’s plan offered a generous amnesty to at least two million illegal immigrants in exchange for funding for a border wall, ending the visa lottery, winding down chain-migration and patching the various legal loopholes which allow migrants to exploit Congress’ “catch and release” laws.Democratic leaders also worked with Republican leaders to cut Trump’s border spending in 2018. They denied increased funding for extra border agent, extra detention beds, and extra border barriers, despite the 2016 election results. The March omnibus only allows construction of 50 miles of new fencing along the 2,000-mile border.The opposition from Congress leaves Trump with fewer tools to stem the wage-cutting illegal and legal immigration into the United States. But he is using his power over the agencies to improve immigration policies and border defenses, and also is using his power as Commander-in-Chief to deploy the National Guard to the border.The Trump mobilization stands in sharp contrast to the welcome policies set by former President Barack Obama. Those policies allowed more than 400,000 Central American economic migrants into the United States to plead for asylum designed to help persecuted individuals. "

I think that the Border Patrol [is] well trained, well equipped. I don’t think we need the military here on the border.”He added that previous deployments of the National Guard to the border were back when conditions were different.Tuchman also asked, “So, when the White House says this is a crisis and that things are getting worse, your feeling is?”Schmerber responded, “Not here, not in this county.”Schmerber also said state and federal officials haven’t reached out to him.Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"
"b'Ex Mex Prez Vicente Fox Lets \xe2\x80\x98Globalist Cat Out of Bag\xe2\x80\x99 in Farage Debate: Lauds Authoritarian China, Slams Democracy'",http://www.breitbart.com/london/2018/04/06/ex-mex-prez-vicente-fox-lets-globalist-cat-bag-farage-debate-lauds-authoritarian-china-slams-democracy/,"The two men locked horns in the “Nationalism vs. Globalism” debate series, hosted by the Steamboat Institute and moderated by Wall Street Journal’s Mary Kissell.The two traded blows on issues like trade, democracy, the European Union and Trump’s border wall plans for over an hour before President Fox launched into a broadside against the idea of democracy.“You visit China today, you visit the east. No more ideologies,” said Fox, moments after stating his support for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in Mexico’s upcoming Presidential elections.While Fox defeated the 71-year-long “perfect dictatorship” of PRI, which governed uninterrupted for 71 years, he declared his support for the neo-liberal party which also curiously finds itself as a member of the Socialist International group, stating: “I know [the PRI candidate, Meade] has the burden on his shoulder of PRI corruption… I always go more for the person, not for the ideology.“You visit China today, you visit the east. No more ideologies. They don’t fight like dogs and cats here, like Republicans and Democrats do every day. They are pragmatic governments. They work on technology, on exports, on trading”.Kissell — who had declared her and the Wall Street Journal’s bias in favour of Fox at the beginning of the debate — intervened, “They’re authoritarian regimes. They put people in labour camps. They torture them”.“Well,” replied Fox, “I began to doubt how smart is democracy, because democracy’s not delivering. That’s why in Britain they’re not happy with what’s going on. You’re not happy with what’s going on in the United States, you’re not happy with what is going on in Mexico… I see, pretty soon, something different… some other way we’re going to perform governance, that we’re going to take decisions, and how we’re going to manage our countries”.Farage, who received the minority of the speaking time by some margin at the debate, hit back: “I think the globalist cat was just let out of the bag.“We heard President Fox’s contempt for democracy and for what people think. I heard in previous debates he didn’t even think the Brexit result was a fair democratic result. And this is what the globalists want. I’ve no doubt most of them are terribly well educated and frightfully clever and well funded by giant multinationals and they think they know better than the ordinary peasants as to how we should live our lives.“2016 was not just a short term kick back against that mentality. What we said in 2016, despite terrible threats of economic chaos and plagues of black locusts that would descend upon our countries, what we said is we’ve had enough of being talked down to by the globalists. We actually want to live democratically, in our own nations, we’ll co-operate with our neighbours. But honestly, President Fox, you talk about our referendum, and democracy, I think, in pejorative terms.“For many of us, whether in this room or outside, actually, the vote is the most powerful thing we possess as free human beings. We value it. We showed in 2016 just how potent and powerful that can be”.Kissell polled the audience before and after the debate, with over 90 per cent in the room declaring — to Farage’s victory — that the nation-state was not obsolete. Ms. Kissell was confused by her own terminology in assessing the audience vote, and accidentally declared President Fox the winner, despite him losing the vote by about a 90 per cent margin. Mr. Farage corrected her on stage, to the amusement of the audience.President Fox has been a long-standing critic of U.S. President Donald Trump, repeatedly stating that Mexico will not pay for “that f**king wall”.Fox was forced to apologise for his crude behaviour in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News. President Trump accepted his apology.The full debate can be watched below:"
b'Tijuana: 549 Homicides in Three Months',http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2018/04/06/tijuana-549-homicides-2018-amid-mexican-army-deployment/,"A total of 184 killings were noted in March alone, according to local reports.Breitbart Texas previously reported that one of the problems cited by the state attorney general’s office of Baja California is that most homicides go unsolved. Of 132 registered homicides to start 2018, only five resulted in arrests with a total of 11 suspects detained.The bloodshed continues despite the deployment of 400 elements of the Mexican Army there to crack down on cartel violence plaguing the once-popular tourist destination.Tijuana sits on the U.S. border with California, approximately 17 miles south of San Diego. A brief look at both cities reveals that San Diego has a population of 1.4 million compared to Tijuana’s 1.8 million. In 2016 and 2017 respectfully, Tijuana finished with 910 and 1,734 homicides while San Diego registered 50 and 34 for each year in straight comparisons, local journalists found at the time.The cartel violence in Tijuana has been attributed to a resurgence of remnants from the Cártel de Los Arellano Félix, which is now operating under the name of Cártel Tijuana Nueva Generación (CTNG) and aligns with El Cártel de Jalisco Nueva Generación. These two criminal groups are engaged in a turf dispute with the Sinaloa Cartel. In some areas, rival factions within the Sinaloa Cartel are fighting for control of the lucrative street-level markets and valuable routes leading into the United States.Robert Arce is a retired Phoenix Police detective with extensive experience working Mexican organized crime and street gangs. Arce has worked in the Balkans, Iraq, Haiti, and recently completed a three-year assignment in Monterrey, Mexico, working out of the Consulate for the United States Department of State, International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Program, where he was the Regional Program Manager for Northeast Mexico (Coahuila, Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, Durango, San Luis Potosi, Zacatecas.)"
b'AG Jeff Sessions Returns Deportation Orders to Pre-Obama Levels',http://www.breitbart.com/2018-elections/2018/04/06/ag-sessions-returns-deportation-orders-pre-obama-levels/,"But the backlogs created by Obama’s pro-migrant policies are still keeping hundreds of thousands of Central Americans in U.S. jobs, and are still inviting many additional poor Central American migrants to ask for asylum at border posts in Texas and California.The number of illegals beating deportation orders has fallen by half since Obama departed, according to data provided by Syracuse University. In numbers, only 75,556 migrants were ordered home in fiscal 2016, but the departure number under AG Sessions is on track to reach 120,000 in 2018, says the university’s newest data at the Transactional Record Access Clearinghouse.In fiscal 2016, 56 percent of immigrants defeated deportation cases in the immigration-court system run by Obama’s Attorney Generals. But that percentage has quickly dropped to 29 percent in 2018 under Sessions’ oversight, which is slightly above the pre-Obama level which existed before 2009.TRAC’s chart, “Outcomes of Deportation Proceedings in Immigration Court,” shows:In numbers, 97,491 migrants won their deportation cases in 2009, while only 50,000 are likely to win their cases in 2018, according to TRAC. The data is arranged by 12-month fiscal years, so each year starts on the prior October 1, for example, fiscal 2016 begins October 2015.The TRAC data include data from 2017 and 2018. In comparison, the data released by the Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review only goes up to 2016.The flip side of the same TRAC data shows the rising percentage of people who were ordered home by judges in the immigration courts.Under Obama, the deportation percentage fell from 76 percent of cases in fiscal 2008 down to 43.7 percent in fiscal 2016, which started in October 2015.Under Trump, that deportation percentage has moved back up to nearly pre-Obama levels — roughly 70 percent.Only 75,556 illegals were ordered home in fiscal 2016, but the number is on track to reach 120,000 in 2018.Sessions has also been able to process more of the young Central American juveniles who are seeking asylum and green cards, often as “Unaccompanied Alien Children.”In 2018, he won almost 12,000 removal orders and 2,400 voluntary departures, compared to Obama’s 10,000 orders and 800 departures in 2016 when there was a similar number of roughly 42,000 juvenile cases.Under Sessions, almost no juveniles were offered “prosecutorial discretion” in 2017, compared to 2,130 offers in 2016. Each of those offers effectively provided permanent residency to the migrant.The value of Sessions’ gains were highlighted by April 2 statement from the White House about a police operation dubbed “Operation Matador.” The statement said:Ninety-nine individuals arrested during this operation crossed the border as unaccompanied minors, all of which were confirmed as MS-13 gang members. 64 individuals arrested during this operation obtained Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJ) after entering the country, all of which were confirmed as MS-13 gang members. Of the 99 UACs, 64 had SIJ status.Despite these successes, the overall number of pending immigration cases continues to rise as migrants arrive faster than Session’s current 330 immigration judges can process them. Nationwide, the backlog grew from 223,000 in Obama’s first year, up to 513,000 in fiscal 2016 and then continued growing to 629,000 in 2017.The 2018 backlog is likely to reach 684,000, says TRAC. That number includes 90,000 cases in New York, 67,000 in Los Angeles, 53,000 in San Franciso, 49,000 in Houston, and 40,000 in Arlington, Va.The backlog may further increase unless President Donald Trump can quickly reduce the number of migrants who are allowed to file asylum pleases in U.S. courts during 2018.New arrivals are rising rapidly, according to the red line in an April report by the Department of Homeland Security.Sessions has taken several steps to reduce Obama’s backlog. For example, he is hiring 100 extra judges, requiring judges to process cases faster, and is reversing time-consuming or generous precedents that helped more migrants win residency.Sessions’ reforms have enraged wealthy advocates of greater immigration. David Leopold, an immigration lawyer and the former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, slams Sessions, saying:While ICE agents all across the U.S. dutifully execute Trump’s brutal anti-immigrant crackdown, Attorney General Jeff Sessions is turning the nation’s immigration courts into deportation assembly lines where asylum seekers, battered women, unaccompanied children and others seeking justice are processed for removal like cattle to the slaughter.But Sessions’ task is huge.The backlog delays average immigration cases to more than three years, effectively offering migrants a valuable three-year work permit in exchange for just asking for asylum.This federal offer of temporary work-permits via the backlogged court system provides a huge incentive for poor migrants in Central Americans — many of whom hope to work hard for their poor families — to take the expensive and risky journey to the U.S. border posts so they can make a claim for asylum in the backlogged immigration courts. That incentive is what Trump is trying to reduce by deploying the National Guard to the border.The time to decide each immigration case grew from 452 days in Obama’s first year up to 897 days in his last year in 2016. But TRAC foresees little improvement in 2018, perhaps because Sessions’ courthouse reforms have not yet produced enough progress or data.This backlog creates a cheap-labor loophole which puts 300,000 to 600,000 migrants into jobs — such as New York restaurants — throughout the United States. That huge semi-legal workforce reduces marketplace pressure on U.S. companies to pay higher wages, to recruit marginalized workers and to invest in labor-saving machinery or training efforts.Many white-collar progressives scoff at the impact of this cheap-labor pipeline on their blue-collar fellow Americans. Max Boot, a columnist for the Washington Post, wrote:And what horrors will be visited upon the United States if it were to act with a smidgen of kindness and allow a few of the Hondurans in? We would undoubtedly be getting hard-working newcomers who, like most immigrants, will make our country even greater than it is ……Of all the threats in the world, Trump chooses to focus on a few migrants who are, in truth, no threat at all. What is he ignoring? Well, let’s see. A trade war with China that has rattled markets. Russia’s attempted assassinations in Britain. Russian and Iranian war crimes in Syria. The Saudi war in Yemen. The U.S. war in Afghanistan. The Russian invasion of Ukraine. An election in Iraq. Insurgencies in Somalia, Nigeria, Mali, Libya and other countries.However, even when migrants lose their cases, and are ordered deported, many elude the ICE agents and continue to work in the underground economy, alongside the roughly 8 million illegal-immigrant workers.In 2016, 950,062 migrants with deportation orders were still living — and often working — in the United States.Trump’s 2016 pro-American immigration policies are very popular among the public, including among blue-collar African-Americans who are a core element of the Democrats’ current electoral base.Business groups, Democrats, and the establishment media tout misleading, industry-funded “Nation of Immigrants” polls which pressure Americans to say they welcome migrants, including the roughly 3 million ‘dreamer’ illegals.The alternative “priority or fairness” polls — plus the 2016 election — show that voters in the polling booth put a much higher priority on helping their families, neighbors, and fellow nationals get decent jobs in a high-tech, high-immigration, low-wage economy."
b'Michelle Obama Mocks Trump: My Husband Was the \xe2\x80\x98Good Parent\xe2\x80\x99',http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/04/06/michelle-obama-mocks-trump-husband-good-parent/,"My husband, Barack Obama, was “like having the ‘good parent’ at home,” the former first lady said. “The responsible parent, the one who told you to eat your carrots and go to bed on time,” she added.Referring to Trump, she went on, “And now we have the other parent. We thought it’d feel fun — maybe it feels fun for now because we can eat candy all day and stay up late and not follow the rules.”Obama also reiterated that she has no desire to run for president in 2020.“I think people should be less … disheartened that me and Oprah don’t want to run, and more disheartened by the fact that Hillary Clinton, probably the most qualified person to ever seek the office of the presidency, lost. She lost. The reason why I don’t want to run for president — I can’t speak for Oprah, but my sense is that first of all, you have to want the job,” she said.“And you can’t just say, ‘You’re a woman. Run.’ And we can’t look for women like that. We can’t just say ‘let’s find the women we like and ask them to do it,’ because there are a million women who are inclined and who do have the passion for politics,” she added.Of Hillary Clinton, Obama admitted that “She wasn’t perfect, but she was way more perfect than many of the alternatives.”The moderator did not ask any follow up questions. For that reason, we may never know how Obama believes her husband asked us to “eat our vegetables” while he was doubling the national debt — basically creating more debt than all 43 of his predecessors combined, all in order to continue the countless government giveaways that future generations will have to pay for.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

b'Obama Supporters Rush to Save His \xe2\x80\x98Dangerous\xe2\x80\x99 School Leniency Policy for Minority Students',http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/04/06/obama-supporters-rush-save-dangerous-school-leniency-policy-minority-students/,"According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) report– requested by Democrats Rep. Bobby Scott (VA) and Rep. Jerrold Nadler (NY) – national civil rights data for academic year 2013-2014 show “black students, boys, and students with disabilities were disproportionately disciplined (e.g., suspensions and expulsions) in K-12 public schools.”“These disparities were widespread and persisted regardless of the type of disciplinary action, level of school poverty, or type of public school attended,” the report stated, citing that “black students accounted for 15.5 percent of all public school students, but represented about 39 percent of students suspended from school – an overrepresentation of about 23 percentage points.”Politico reports Scott said the GAO report “dispels claims that racially disproportionate rates of discipline are based solely on income.”“This report underscores the need to combat these gross disparities by strengthening, not rescinding, the 2014 Discipline Guidance Package, which recommends specific strategies to reduce the disparities without jeopardizing school safety,” he added.The report is not “news,” since no one has disputed that minority students are disciplined at higher rates than whites and Asians. At issue is that Obama supporters attribute those higher rates to racism by teachers and school administrators.“There are no surprises in the GAO report,” University of San Diego law professor Gail Heriot, a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, confirms to Breitbart News. “From time immemorial, we’ve known boys get disciplined more often than girls. It’s just that in the past nobody was silly enough to argue that anti-male bias was the primary reason.”“It has also been known for a long time that African American students are disciplined more often than white students, and that white students are disciplined more often than Asian students,” Heriot continued. “Again, however, that doesn’t mean that African American students are being discriminated against vis-a-vis white students or that white students are being discriminated against vis-a-vis Asian students.”Heriot says the primary reason for the disparities is differences in the rates of misbehavior.“Much of it is associated with disadvantaged backgrounds,” she observes. “African Americans are more likely to come from poor and fatherless households.”The disparities in discipline rates is apparently acknowledged by black students themselves.Another study recently released by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) reveals that black students report being in a fight at school at a rate that is more than twice that for white students.According to the NCES study, in 2015, data from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey showed 13 percent of black students reported being in a physical fight on school property, while 6 percent of white and 6 percent of Asian students reported the same. The highest percentage of student reports of fights on school property was for Pacific Islanders at 21 percent.“The percentage of students who reported being in a physical fight on school property was also higher for American Indian/Alaska Native students (13 percent), students of two or more races (9 percent), and Hispanic students (9 percent) than for White students,” the NCES study reports.Additionally, 32 percent of black students reported having been in a physical fight anywhere during the previous year, while 23 percent of Hispanic students, 20 percent of white students, and 15 percent of Asian students reported the same.In a law review article on school discipline, Heriot and her colleague Alison Somin assert the Obama directive is “wrongheaded” and has introduced a higher level of “danger” to schools.The authors write:What if an important reason more African-American students were being disciplined than white or Asian students is that more African-American students were misbehaving? And what if the cost of failing to discipline those students primarily falls on their fellow African-American students who are trying to learn amid classroom disorder? Would unleashing OCR [Office for Civil Rights] and its army of lawyers cause those schools to act carefully and precisely to eliminate only that portion of the discipline gap that was the result of race discrimination? Or—more likely—would schools react heavy-handedly by tolerating more classroom disorder, thus making it more difficult for students who share the classroom with unruly students to learn?Attorney Peter Kirsanow, also a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and chairman of the board of directors of the Center for New Black Leadership, also observes to Breitbart News the literature on racial disparities in disciplinary rates often omits key data.“Much of the literature that focuses on racial disparities in disciplinary rates recites statistics showing that black and Hispanic students are 3—4 times more likely to be suspended than white and Asian students,” he explains. “But the same literature often leaves out data showing that black and Hispanic students are far more likely than white and Asian students to commit the types of offenses resulting in suspension.”“There is some evidence that black students are more likely to be suspended than white students for some of the same infractions,” he adds. “But a closer look at the data shows that’s not necessarily due to discrimination, but rather, the disciplinary policies of specific schools or school administrators. Some black school administrators at majority-black schools punish black students more harshly than white school administrators punish white (or black) students at majority white schools.”Kirsanow also observes that, by most accounts, “students with disabilities are ‘overrepresented’ among  the ranks of disciplined students.”“That isn’t necessarily unexpected,” he states. “’Disabilities’ include behavioral disabilities. But the pro-Obama disciplinary guidance crowd  doesn’t  disaggregate  students with behavioral disabilities from those with, for example, physical impairments.  Consequently, the impression often left in the minds of the public is that rampaging teachers and administrators are unfairly suspending or expelling students with visual, auditory, or ambulatory disabilities.”Nevertheless, Democrats and left-leaning media support the Obama directive – still in use during the Trump administration – that coerces schools to supposedly end the “school-to-prison pipeline” for minority students by not reporting their assaultive and threatening behavior to law enforcement. Schools that do not comply with the leniency policy have been threatened with federal investigations and a loss of federal funding.The failure by a school to report a violent or threatening student to law enforcement means that such a student could purchase a firearm, a situation that is being reviewed in Parkland, Florida, where accused shooter Nikolas Cruz, with multiple incidents of past violent and assaultive behavior – but no arrests, killed 17 people and injured others at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School with a firearm.Results of the GAO study were released as DeVos and the Federal Commission on School Safety, met to consider the repeal of the Obama school discipline policy.School personnel who met with DeVos and her commission Wednesday included Annette Albright, a former Charlotte-Mecklenburg, North Carolina, black administrator who reported she was violently assaulted by black students and then terminated by her school district because she supposedly provoked the attack, and Nicole Stewart, a former San Diego vice principal who told Breitbart News she immediately observed a lack of discipline at Lincoln High School when she arrived.“There were hesitations in suspending and you had to commit a really heinous crime to be expelled,” Stewart said. “They had adopted this ‘blue-slipping’ procedure for students they didn’t want to suspend on the record, but they also wanted to send that student home because they were a danger to themselves and the campus.”“There is a culture of violence as a result of people not wanting to expel or suspend students,” she added.Kirsanow and Heriot agree the Obama policy should be rescinded.“The goal should be issue nondiscriminatory discipline appropriate to the offense, not to lower disciplinary standards so racial disparities aren’t as great,” Kirsanow asserts. “We’re sacrificing good students (and teachers) on the altars of political correctness, racial bean counting, and misguided theories of social justice. This is both boneheaded and tragic.”"
b'Mark Levin: Media Treat Mueller Like He Is a Judge \xe2\x80\x94 He Is a \xe2\x80\x98Rogue Prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99 Investigating Nothing',http://www.breitbart.com/video/2018/04/06/mark-levin-media-treat-mueller-like-he-is-a-judge-he-is-a-rogue-prosecutor-investigating-nothing/,"Thursday on Fox News Channel’s “Hannity,” nationally syndicated talk show host Mark Levin questioned the role of special counsel Robert Mueller and the boundaries he has crossed with his investigation into alleged interference of Russia in the 2016 presidential election.According to Levin, Mueller has overstepped.Partial transcript as follows:HANNITY: Joining us now the host of CRTV Levin TV and the host of :Life, Liberty and Levin” right here on the Fox News Channel. As a matter of fact, this weekend, Governor Palin is going to be your guest on the show. I always liked Governor Palin. And we haven’t heard from her in a while. I look forward to watching, Mark.All right. So the big question now is what the president needs to do. Apparently, the president’s lawyers negotiated with the special counsel over the idea that the president would speak with Robert Mueller.The president himself is like I have nothing to hide. I’d speak with him. But if there is no underlying crime, if collusion is not a crime and the president has the right to fire Comey or anybody else and even Comey admitted as much, then the question is, you know, if they want to get into the president’s mindset, your thoughts can’t represent a crime in my opinion. You are the constitutional expert. Would you allow if the president was your client, would you allow him to speak to Robert Mueller?LEVIN: No. Let me tell you. I wouldn’t allow him to speak for his sake or the sake of the office of the presidency. Because this is a rogue prosecutor, who is investigating nothing. You understand that? He is investigating nothing. There is no underlying crime.When he got his appointment by the deputy attorney general, the deputy attorney general did not provide a basis for the appointment. That is, he didn’t say here are the criminal statutes I want you to investigate. Because there aren’t any.I want to make a point that I don’t believe anybody else has made. And this is very, very important for the president, and for the president’s lawyers and the nation.The official position of the United States Department of Justice under Democrat administration and Republican administration was set out by the Office of Legal Counsel. That’s the constitutional office within the Department of Justice in two memoranda.And this memoranda says the president of the United States cannot be indicted while he is in office. Cannot be indicted while he is in office. So he can’t be a criminal target. The president of the United States can’t be a criminal target because he can’t be indicted.That’s the official position of Mr. Mueller’s bosses over there at the Department of Justice. That’s number one. Number two, I keep hearing well, but what if he is subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury? Subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury.Well, then you go to the federal judge, and you say to the federal judge your honor, my client can’t be indicted. That is the position of his bosses so why is he going in front of a federal grand jury? What we need him as a witness. A witness to what? What criminal statute, or what criminal violation do you think he was a witness to that he needs to testify to?Well, we think he may have committed obstruction. And even though we may not charge him — excuse me, Mr. Mueller. This is a criminal grand jury. This isn’t being done so you can issue your report. So there are many constitutional obstacles of course to this argument that the president obstructed justice.So firing a subordinate that’s obstructing justice? That’s absurd. If that’s obstructing justice then when Mr. Mueller fired Mr. Strzok, maybe that’s obstruction of justice, too, interfering with an investigation.What I’m saying is when I watch people come on TV and say he can be subpoenaed. Well, anybody can be subpoenaed. He is the president of the United States. And you damn well better have a strong reason for trying to drag him in front of a grand jury, that’s number one.Number two, a federal judge is not going to just accept that kind of a spectacle, and Mr. Mueller knows is. That’s why they are trying to negotiate at least some kind of a deal. You are going to drag a president who is dealing with all of these issues all over the world, who’s dealing with China, Russia, North Korea, Iran and so forth and so on, and bring him in front of a grand jury? A judge is not going to want that kind of constitutional crisis.That’s why Mr. Mueller is trying to negotiate some basis to interview Mr. Trump. But if I were Mr. Trump I’d say you know what? I didn’t do anything wrong, and that’s exactly why I’m not talking to you. That’s number one. I’m going to protect this office for Democrat and Republicans who elected to the president of the United States, that’s number two.You have crimes that you want to prosecute? Go for it, baby. But I didn’t commit a crime. I’m not going to be indicted. I’m not going to be dragged in front of a federal grand jury, and that’s that. That’s what the president should say.HANNITY: Let me ask you this next question because I think this is key. And there’s been very few of us that have done this deep dive into this. I would argue that corrupt team that Robert Mueller put together.Everyone says he is beyond reproach. Well, look at his handling in the anthrax case post-9/11. Look at, you know, the case when he was in Boston as it relates to Whitey Bolger. Four innocent people went to jail, a $100,000 plus settlement. Two of those guys, two of the four died in jail.And then you got this guy Andrew Weissmann the New York Time calls the Mueller’s pit bull. OK. That’s a guy that as a result of his actions twice was excoriated by judges for withholding exculpatory evidence. Tens of thousands of jobs who lost at Anderson County for no reason at all.LEVIN: Right.HANNITY: Overturned 9, zero in the Supreme Court. You and I both know that doesn’t happen a lot. And a guy that sent four Maryland executives to jail, Mar, four for a year, and that was overturned by the fifth circuit.LEVIN: Right.HANNITY: Wait a minute. Why would Robert Mueller with his background be appointing only Obama, only Hillary, only DNC donors and corrupt people like Weissmann to his team to be his pit bull?LEVIN: And why are the Democrats so keen on him? Why are the media so keen on him? There is a lot of leaks coming out of that operation, too. Among them to The Washington Post the other day. He wants to put a report out by June or July. Where they are probably going to suggest the president of the United States committed obstruction of justice.Not only is that outrageous, to the extent he does a report it’s supposed to be to the deputy attorney general on the crime he’s found or the crimes he’s prosecuting. He is not supposed to be given opinions.Let’s be clear about something. The media treats this guy like he is a judge. He’s not a judge. He’s a prosecutor. And there are two sides to every argument. That’s number one. Number two, he is going to put out a report accusing the president of the United States of obstruction of justice? When, in fact, that means that the president of the United States will be accused of obstruction of justice for impeachment purposes?That leak should tell the president of the United States everything he needs to know, which is that Mueller is out to destroy him.HANNITY: All right.LEVIN: He is out to run a report to give it to the Democrats and the House of Representatives.HANNITY: We have a little over a minute left. And I would argue he would stepping right into a perjury trap. If there is no underlying crime and they can’t indict the president.LEVIN: Defend the office of the presidency and defend yourself.HANNITY: Well said. That is why we call you the great one. Rod Rosenstein, he shouldn’t even be in the position, number one. Number two, isn’t he conflicted out if he is the number one witness as it relates to obstruction with Comey because he wrote a letter recommending such?And in fact, he signed on to this, extended this FISA warrant himself? Knowing that this was bought and paid for Hillary propaganda, Russian lies? And then appoints Mueller. How does he get away with the conflict? How do you see him in all this?LEVIN: I see him as very bizarre. And really out of line. In addition to everything you said, we now know when that Mueller went in to Mr. Manafort’s apartment at 5 or 6 in morning when he and his wife were in bed, with the FBI’s were the guns drawn, he got a warrant from a federal judge, when he went in there, and he gathered information and then he goes to the deputy attorney general a week later to have his authority expanded to cover what he had just done a week before.So Mr. Rosenstein expands his authority to cover the tracks for Mueller who was doing things he shouldn’t have done. And the reason why this is important, America, is this. Mr. Rosenstein is not the attorney general of the United States.HANNITY: I got to go. Well said.LEVIN: And he is acting like it.HANNITY: All right.Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor"
b'\xe2\x80\x98Masters of the Universe\xe2\x80\x99 Panel: There Is No Way to Compete with Google and Facebook',http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/04/06/masters-of-the-universe-panel-there-is-no-way-to-compete-with-google-and-facebook/,"“Isn’t it time for some serious competition for these people, and wouldn’t we have a lot of conservatives, millions of people across the country, flock to these other outlets that would be fair and wouldn’t be biased?” a member of the audience asked, proposing a free-market challenge as preferable to regulatory solutions.“It’s very expensive to start a TV network. We could use another one,” author and lawyer Ann Coulter pointed out. “But Facebook, Twitter, and Google are different. You cannot compete with them. You can’t.”“I mean, I wish Gab the best,” she continued, referring to the upstart social media platform that offers a free speech alternative to Twitter. “Twitter is the smallest of them, and perhaps Gab can come in and do it.”“But Facebook, it’s too late now. Google — well, you can explain why Google, they just have the best search engine,” Coulter continued, indicating fellow panelist Dr. Robert Epstein. “You’re not going to make your own search engine. It is a natural monopoly.”“You may think if you are on Yahoo or another platform, you are not using Google,” Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer interjected. “That’s not really true.”“Why do I get stuck explaining all the really scary stuff?” Dr. Epstein sighed comically.Epstein asked the iPhone users in the audience to identify themselves. “Do you know where Siri gets all of her answers from? Google,” he told them.“Do you know where Yahoo gets most or all of its search engine answers from?” he continued. “Yahoo’s not really a search engine anymore. They haven’t crawled the Internet for years. They get it from Google.”“Google’s influence just keeps spreading and spreading without us being aware,” Epstein said. “There’s an illusion of some competition and so on, but actually there’s less and less and less competition. Google’s index is the best. It’s the biggest. How can you compete with that?”“It’s been estimated that they have at least 45 billion web pages in their index, and that was a couple of years ago. It must be much larger right now,” he observed. “The next-largest index that people could track at the time was Bing. Bing is a Microsoft product. It was 14 billion. So where are you going to get better answers from? Bing sucked. Bing was terrible. The fact is Google really does what they do really, really, really well.”“But you know, ‘free’ is not freedom,” Epstein cautioned. “When you get something that looks like it’s free, it’s not. Your moms and dads told you that when you were young, right? You get what you pay for. That’s the situation here, is that we have this illusion, we’re getting all this free stuff and it’s awesome, and it’s great, and it works so well that everything is okay. It’s not. The more information you give them, the larger those profiles get, and the more control they have over you. And you don’t know what’s happening with those data.”Epstein added that another reason competing with the established tech giants is nearly impossible is that they are integrated with numerous other systems, such as corporate email accounts. This also gives companies like Google the opportunity to harvest even more data from partner services and integrated systems.“When I get emails from editors at Time magazine, the New York Times, the Guardian — I could go on and on and on — I want to see what computers those emails have run through. Guess what? These big news companies all use Google to run their email system. All of these emails are running through Google servers.”“I’m talking about top journalists, some of the top journalists in the world, who are investigating Google! They’re sharing all of their communications, all of their work products, all of the drafts —they’re sharing it all with Google,” he marveled.“Google and Facebook’s power is not just in the United States,” Epstein noted. “90 percent of all search around the world is done on Google. Outside of Russia and China, Google and Facebook, they’re it. They’re the most powerful mind-control machine that has ever existed in the history of humankind.”"
"b'Dr. Robert Epstein: \xe2\x80\x98The More Google Knows About You, the Easier It Is for Them to Manipulate You\xe2\x80\x99'",http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/04/06/dr-robert-epstein-the-more-google-knows-about-you-the-easier-it-is-for-them-to-manipulate-you/,"“The more information these companies have about us, the more easily they can manipulate us,” Epstein said. This was a particularly disturbing thought given how much of the “Masters of the Universe” discussion concerned the shocking degree of surveillance Big Tech companies are subjecting their customers to, using products from web browsers and email services to cell phones and voice command gadgets that constantly monitor every sound in the home.He warned that sophisticated techniques designed to influence shopping and web browsing habits could also be used to manipulate votes.“I did a piece for the Daily Caller, a piece I wrote with Ben Edelman of the Harvard School. We estimated that if these companies were all working together and supporting the same candidate, and really pulling out all the stops and using all the methods they have to manipulate, they could shift ten percent of the voting population of America with no one knowing that they had done this, and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to track,” Epstein said.“Ten percent could be shifted. That’s a lot of votes, with no one knowing they had done this,” he remarked.Epstein said he has invested years of research to determine how many votes can be shifted by techniques such as Google manipulating search results.“It turns out what’s at the top of the list, people believe is better and truer than what’s lower in the list,” he revealed. “That’s why 50 percent of all clicks go to the top two items.” “We showed in our studies that if you favor one candidate in search results, meaning higher-ranked results make that candidate look better – you click on it, it takes you to a web page that makes that candidate look really good – if you favor one candidate in search results, among voters that are undecided you can easily shift at least 20 percent of them toward that candidate, up to 80 percent in at least one demographic group that we found,” he said.Epstein did not keep the audience in suspense for long in revealing the identity of that group.“The most vulnerable group that we’ve ever found so far in our five years of studies is moderate Republicans,” he said.“We came up with a monitoring system for monitoring search results on Google, Bing, and Yahoo for nearly six months before the election in 2016,” he recalled. “We found that Google’s search results favored Hillary Clinton in all ten positions of those search results on the first page. All ten positions, for almost all of those six months leading up to the election. Now, that’s enough to shift two to three million votes, at least, without anyone knowing that they have been manipulated.”Another aspect of search engine manipulation Epstein studied is the auto-complete feature, which guesses the remaining words in a query as the user types. Auto-completion is ostensibly based on the searches other users are performing, but he remembered following up on a report that “when you’re typing in search terms, you can’t get negatives for Hillary Clinton on Google.”“Eight people on my staff spent that summer of 2016 – this I published in the fall of that year – seeing if we could get negatives for Hillary Clinton. For example, we’d type in on Bing and Yahoo, we’d type in ‘Hillary Clinton Is…’ and we’d get, ‘Hillary Clinton is the devil,’ ‘Hillary Clinton is sick,’ ‘Hillary Clinton is dying of cancer.’ Hillary Clinton is, literally, eight or ten extremely negative suggestions, because that’s in fact what people were searching for.”“Then we’d go to Google,” he continued. “We’d type in, ‘Hillary Clinton is…’ and we’d get, ‘Hillary Clinton is awesome,’ ‘Hillary Clinton is winning,’ and that’s it.”“We started doing some serious research just on those suggestions they flash at you when you start to type a search term, and what we have now learned, we have all the details on this — and one of the major news sources is going to be breaking the story about our new work in this area, I can’t go into details about it until the story breaks — but what we have found is you are being manipulated from the very first character that you type into that search bar,” Epstein revealed.An extended discussion of Dr. Epstein’s work on Google search results from September 2016 can be found here.“The more Google knows about you, the easier it is for them to manipulate you,” he reiterated. “This is without you having any idea that this is occurring.”Epstein was prepared for the objection that Donald Trump still won the 2016 election despite these manipulation techniques, so they must not be all that effective. As fellow panelist Ann Coulter recalled him telling her before the event: “They weren’t trying to stop Trump, because they were so confident it was gonna be Hillary. But henceforth it’s going to be pedal to the metal against Trump, and now we’re going to see what they can do.”“They held back,” Epstein put in after Coulter related this conversation. “They will never hold back again. I guarantee it.”"
b'Triggered: Jimmy Kimmel Delivers Bizarre Sex Rant over Sean Hannity\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Ass Clown\xe2\x80\x99 Taunt',http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2018/04/06/triggered-jimmy-kimmel-jumps-sean-hannitys-erection/,"“Ass-clown Kimmel,” Hannity said on his Fox News show (after playing the clip of Kimmel mocking the First Lady),  “Hey Mr. Kimmel, that’s her fifth language. How many do you speak?”Kimmel then played the Hannity clip on his own late night show and before going to town on Hannity’s “erection.”“Sean Hannity’s problem is that for eight years, while Obama was President, he was unable to get an erection. For eight years, not one erection. And he tried everything … he tried looking at pictures of Paul Ryan with his shirt off. Didn’t work,” Kimmel said.But the last-place late-night host was nowhere near finished with Hannity’s erection.“[Hannity] went to office Christmas parties with Bill O’Reilly,” Kimmel continued. “Nothing worked. But now that Trump is president, here’s the twist, Sean Hannity is unable to have anything but an erection. He’s had an erection since November of 2016. And it’s driving him mad. He’s lost his mind.”Kimmel, who recently hosted the lowest-rated Academy Award show in history, then got all over Hannity’s “ass.”An obviously angry Kimmel wondered, “Why is Sean Hannity openly fantasizing about clowns in the ass? Is that your thing — at two a.m. you got your laptop open to Breitbart, you sneak into the den to hump a pillow from the Ivanka Trump collection — quietly, so your wife doesn’t wake up and force you to go to church.Not finished with Hannity’s “ass,” Kimmel added:“Sean, you are the whole ass circus. You’re the juggler, you’re the trapeze artist, you are the ass lion tamer and the ass human cannonball all jammed into one little car. You’re the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey of ass clownsmanship.”The pair took their battle to Twitter early Friday morning.“So @jimmykimmel (aka Harvey Weinstein jr) I’ll have much more tomorrow…… @Disney Tick Tock..

b'Hawkins: Why Celebrities Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t Use the YouTube HQ Shooting to Push Gun Control',http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2018/04/06/hawkins-why-celebrities-youtube-hq-shooting-to-push-gun-control/,"Think about it — celebrities went gun control crazy following the October 1, 2017, Las Vegas attack. Julianne Moore, Emma Stone, Melissa McCarthy, Adam Scott, Laura Dern, and others even took part in a Everytown for Gun Safety PSA, in which they urged opposition to proposed concealed carry laws as a result of the attack.And celebrities called for more gun control within hours of the November 5, 2017, Texas church attack. Such celebrities included Sarah Silverman, Stephen King, Josh Gad, Chelsea Handler, Joy Reid, Adam McKay, among others.Following the February 14, 2018, Parkland school attack, celebrities came out in droves for gun control and they brought their friends. They expressed their solidarity with student gun control advocates, praised the idea of a national march for gun control, and George Clooney, Steven Spielberg, Oprah Winfrey, and Jeffrey Katzenberg pledged $500,000 each to help fund the march.Yet, after the YouTube HQ shooting what did we hear? … Crickets.Sure, actor Michael Ian Black blamed the NRA and called for more gun control before the facts of the shooting were known. Actress Alyssa Milano appeared to blamed the NRA as well. But these two proved to be outliers. The usual Hollywood suspects remained eerily quiet and a few, like Judd Apatow, just retweeted the crazy gun control comments Michael Ian Black was churning out.Why the silence? After all, three innocents were shot with a firearm in an attack that seized the nation’s attention.The answer is found by understanding the common denominators in stories onto which leftist celebrities usually seize.For example, Las Vegas, the Texas church, and Parkland all feature white male gunmen. This fits well into the left’s lexicon and furthers their opportunity for discussing certain other political categories — like racism, white privilege, etc.Also note that an AR-15 was used in Vegas, Texas, and Parkland. This, too, is a convenient fit into their “assault weapons” or “assault rifle” phraseology, and it furthers the left’s opportunity to claim that AR-15s have become the “weapon of choice” for mass shooters.Then came April 3, and news began pouring in about an active shooter at YouTube HQ. A collective gasp filled rooms where celebrities sat and talked, as they waited to see if this would be the attack that finally put their gun control push over the top. But as they waited, the news faltered. The shooter was a female. Moreover, she was Iranian. And she used a handgun instead of an “assault weapon.”It was learned that the YouTube HQ shooter had passed a background check for her handgun and had registered it with the state, per California law. Additionally, Breitbart News reported that California already has every law that has been proposed as a solution to the Parkland attack — including gun confiscation orders — but none of these laws stopped the YouTube HQ shooting.So celebrities moved on, choosing silence over the option of drawing attention to a shooting that highlights the impotence of every gun control law they support, demonstrates the weakness of the claim that AR-15s are the “weapon of choice,” and deviates from their preferred category of “white male shooter.”AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

b'Nolte: Kevin Williamson\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99 Firing Should Wake Up #NeverTrump (But It Won\xe2\x80\x99t)',http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2018/04/06/nolte-kevin-williamsons-atlantic-firing-wake-nevertrump-wont/,"In order to chase after “prestige” at the left-wing Atlantic, this genius Williamson quit his job at National Review and then found himself fired after writing exactly one essay. Worse still, Williamson was shown the door even after using his introduction essay to prove his fealty to his new Masters by trashing his former employer and one of its few remaining decent writers (most National Review-ers are now like Williamson — disguising every column as a plea for a job at a “respectable” publication).Williamson was fired over his swaggering desire to see women who have abortions “hanged.” The quotes, which were dug up by Williamson’s new establishment  colleagues at Media Matters, are typical of Williamson: boastfully thoughtless trolling from a man who frequently confuses his “incoherent and cruel” (hat tip: Victor Davis Hanson) prose with Hemmingway-esque strut.Obviously, such a belief is a heresy against the left-wing sacrament of abortion. Additionally, it piles on the unpardonable sin of making left-wing women feel bad about their lifestyles (and in the era of #MeToo, instead of fighting back with more free speech, and as if to prove they really are the weaker sex, left-wing women now jump on a chair to scream “mouse” and demand to be saved).Banishment, Scarlet Letters, promising to fill the gaping egos of soft-bellied conservatives… Let me explain to the self-absorbed tribe of NeverTrump  how the establishment media operates, how it has always operated….The seduction usually begins in green rooms, and always starts with a question like, “You don’t really think Donald Trump should be president, do you?” For the record, the question used to be, “You don’t really like Ann Coulter, do you?”And it is at this point where you can either be a man or a squealing little gerbil.There is no question the gerbil route is by far the most lucrative. Suddenly the Beautiful People love and respect you, treat you like a circus freak one of their own. Suddenly you find yourself at the center of their world as they hang on your every word. And the more you distance yourself from the Breit-tards and Christian-tards who are “ruining conservatism,” the more they love you.Warm and cozy in the rarified waters of “respectability,” it is exhilarating to finally be swimming with the Keymasters (to book deals and TEEVEE!!), and it is all going to be okay because your “enlightenment” regarding Trump is good enough for them to see that you are “one of the good ones.”At this point you are also able to convince yourself that these are good people, not the Borg, not a group of soulless gangsters out to crush anyone not like them. How could they be anything but good? After all, they like you, and you agreeing to be just a little “reasonable” has already put you thisclose to escaping the hick ghetto, to adding “Atlantic Contributor” to your Twitter profile, to having Jake Tapper ask your opinion on Things That Matter, to a book deal, to endless green rooms, to acceptance and love, to the bottomless pit of your self-regard being empty no more.Except…Take a look around, NeverTrump morons… You can either go the full-woke — in which case you are so immune you can still work at the Atlantic even after confessing your belief that “the police and firefighters who sacrificed their lives” on September 11 are “not quite human” — or you can find yourself a target for annihilation for using the word “whining” or some dumb provocation about hanging women who have abortions.Take a look around, you pious preeners…  The only way those who once described themselves as “conservatives” survive in the Prestigious Media is if they agree to sellout completely and forever — if they agree to Big Brother’s terms and on TV screens all across the country repudiate everything they once stood for  (see: Scarborough, Joe or Wallace, Nicole or Frum, David). Otherwise, they get the Jeffrey Lord treatment.Them’s the rules, nitwits — that is the current Cold War we are in, and it is an existential war launched by a billion-dollar media establishment populated by corporate blacklisters determined to destroy our speech platforms by shrinking the window of acceptable debate. And while the moral cowards in NeverTrump pretend to live in some Masturbatory Fantasyland where they can cozy up to the villains while cowering under a blanket of “muh principles” and Stormy sanctimony, the rest of us have figured out that this is the only fight that matters.“What did you do during the war, daddy?”“I was a squealing little gerbil.”Maybe Kevin Williamson will take his own advice to the working class — rent a U-Haul and learn computer coding. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

The quotes caused many to speculate that social justice issues would feature prominently on Get Up!.The speculation that Get Up! would be more “woke” than sports rose to such a fever pitch that Mike Greenberg felt it necessary to come out to insist that social justice issues would not be a major part of the show.However, for now, it appears no one is paying much attention to what Mike Greenberg and his co-hosts are talking about, politics or otherwise.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston."

b'Report: Michigan State Mishandled Hundreds of Allegations of Child Sex Abuse by Larry Nassar',http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/04/06/report-michigan-state-mishandled-hundreds-of-allegations-of-child-sex-abuse-by-larry-nassar/,"According to the report, Michigan State University officials focused more on protecting the university than on the reports of child sex abuse that poured in from victims of Dr. Larry Nassar, a former USA Gymnastics national team doctor and an osteopathic physician at Michigan State University. Nassar was sentenced in January to 40 to 175 years in Michigan state prison after he pleaded guilty to seven counts of sexual assault of minors.The report claims that 243 victims reported abuse by Nassar to the Michigan State University police department since 2014. Nearly all of the victims were minors when the abuse took place.In a section of the document about Nassar victim Amanda Thomashow, the committee writes that Michigan State University failed to properly investigate Thomashow’s abuse complaint. The university aggressively denies that they failed to properly investigate the complaint despite evidence that suggests otherwise.“MSU failed to properly investigate Nassar in response to the Title IX complaint filed by Amanda Thomashow in 2014,” the report reads. “By doing so, it may have enabled the abuse of others which otherwise might have been prevented.”“We feel compelled to note MSU appears to defiantly and wrongfully maintain it did not mishandle this investigation,” a footnote on the document reads. “For example, MSU defends the conclusion of the 2014 report finding Nassar’s abuse of Ms. Thomashow was medically appropriate on the basis that the facts of her case were materially different from those of a later investigation which reached the opposite conclusion.”Thomashow spoke during the second day of Nassar’s sentencing in January. “At the end of a long and tiring appointment, that man sent his resident out of the room and then stuck his hand up my shirt and down my pants,” Thomashow said. “He sexually assaulted me in spite of my protests and would not let me leave until I agreed to come back for a follow-up assault. It was terrifying and disgusting and I spent days in shock from the violation I had experienced at his hands.”“I waited to hear back from the university for days, for weeks, and I started to feel uneasy again. I started to give up hope. I worried my words hadn’t been taken to heart,” Thomashow added.“The investigation done by MSU was brief and sloppy and it left me feeling disposable and worthless,” she stated"
b'Aluminum Prices Fall Despite New Tariffs',http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/04/05/aluminum-prices-fall-despite-new-tariffs/,"The stock market stubbornly refused to crash for a second day Thursday despite China’s announcement that it would slap tariffs on $50 billion of goods imported from the U.S. The trade war panic will have to wait for another day.More surprisingly, the new tariffs on aluminum are not weighing on American consumers and manufacturers as so many predicted. In fact, aluminum prices have fallen since Trump imposed the tariffs.The Wall Street Journal reports:U.S. aluminum prices are falling despite a tariff aimed at boosting domestic production of the metal.That’s good news for manufacturers of products such as beer cans and car hoods, which are paying 3% less for aluminum than they were before the Trump administration announced the tariff on March 1. These manufacturers said at the time that the 10% tariff on foreign aluminum could push up prices and cause a domestic aluminum shortage just as their orders pick up in a strong economy.And while a delivery premium applied to aluminum in the U.S. rose more than 40% in the weeks before the tariff order went into effect on March 23, that surcharge has fallen recently in anticipation of adequate supplies in the months ahead. Overall, the U.S. price for aluminum last week was $2,415 per metric ton, down 6% from a recent peak in February.One reason tariffs are not sending prices through the roof is that U.S. aluminum producers are increasing supply. Another is that the Trump administration has shown a lot of flexibility when it comes to the tariffs, nimbly exempting some of the top aluminum producing countries.Of course, just as many market pundits are convinced the trade war crash will come someday, those who predicted skyrocketing consumer prices due to higher aluminum prices are not admitting any mistake. The reckoning has simply been delayed, they claim. Prices are certain to go higher, any day now, really."

He repeated his message on Twitter that the United States had already lost the trade war with China.“We don’t have a trade war, we lost the trade war,” Trump said, pointing out former presidents Bill Clinton, both Bushes and Barack Obama all failed to address the trade disparity with China.He reminded the audience that he campaigned to be tough on China.“The easiest thing for me to do would be to just close my eyes and forget it — if I did that, I’m not doing my job,” Trump said. "
b'Egg Farmer at White House Easter Egg Roll: Business Is Up from \xe2\x80\x98Really Bad\xe2\x80\x99 Two Years Ago',http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/04/05/egg-farmer-at-white-house-easter-egg-roll-business-is-up-from-really-bad-two-years-ago/,"Business for egg farming is “very good” these days, much better than when it was “really bad” about two years ago when prices were low, according to Dooyema, who has been working on his family’s farm, Center Fresh Egg in Sioux Center, Iowa, since graduating high school.“Right now we’re enjoying one of the best times in the egg industry as far as prices goes,” said Dooyema, who attributed the change to increased demand.Demand for eggs was about 250 eggs per person annually around two years ago but has risen to 279 currently, according to Dooyema. This falls roughly in line with data published by statistic.com and was provided in American Egg Board materials available at the Easter Egg Roll event. He predicted that the trend is on track to see annual, per person egg consumption climb another four to five in the year ahead.Why do people want more eggs? Dooyema said, “It’s a cheap source of protein” and that the scientific community is recognizing “the true benefits of eggs. It’s got choline, lutein, zeaxanthin … it’s very important for fetal brain development.” He added that there are studies showing eggs are also great for older individuals battling Alzheimer’s.Center Fresh Egg Farm participates in providing an egg a day to school children in Mozambique, Africa. Dooyema recalled traveling there and seeing a child eat an egg for the first time. He said the children had never seen an egg before and tried to eat the shell along with the hardboiled egg inside before being taught not to.U.S. egg exports have been growing with the presence of bird flu in other countries and since the U.S. saw the disease back in 2015, said Dooyema. Hong Kong, Mexico, and Canada are among the most prevalent importers of U.S. eggs. He added that NAFTA doesn’t significantly affect egg exports. U.S. egg farmers are primarily concerned with domestic egg sales.Asked about the regulatory environment for egg farmers, Dooyema said that “The paperwork that’s involved nowadays is just incredible compared to 10, 15, even five years ago.” He called the level of documentation required to comply with rules and regulations is “unmanageable.” As the Trump administration has emphasized government deregulation, egg farming is not one of the areas that has seen a piece of that deregulation, according to the egg farmer.“Nowadays it’s all about protecting your business and not being involved in a lawsuit,” said Dooyema who named this as a more pressing issue than deregulation. “The more documentation you have, the less chance of something coming back on you.” He mentioned “traceback” as a pressing issue. Farming operations face liability when someone gets sick from a product and it can be traced back to a particular farm.The American Egg Board has been providing eggs for the Easter Egg Roll for 40 years. They donated 30,000 hard boiled eggs for Monday’s celebration.Dooyema particularly appreciated the military families at the Easter Egg Roll,:“It’s just incredible to see, it’s just big happy family here.” He also drew attention to a virtual reality hen house as part of the Easter Egg Roll event activities. He added that it’s only now under the Trump administration that Egg Board members have been allowed to attend the event. “Under the Trump administration, it’s really opened up to the egg farmer … you’ve probably seen a big change from the Obama administration to the Trump administration as far as now it’s kind of a family affair and it’s not a big production and a glitzy, glamour … it’s a lot of family here now I think, compared to the past.”Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana "

ZNCC ultimately built the entire system at a cost of approximately $60 million.Since the Afghan government has not acquired any privately held land, Afghans still reside, in some instances, directly under transmission lines.SIGAR found that the contractor only connected the system to its power source temporarily.“As a result of this, along with right-of-way issues not being resolved, NEPS III cannot be fully tested and commissioned or become operational,” it adds."

We have bigger problems in America than Melania Trump’s humiliation. The first lady needs to step up and start doing her job.That’s right. Her job.Glanton also said in her column that because Trump is married to the president, she “campaigned hard” for the job she is not doing.“The first lady would rather we close our eyes and give her a pass,” Glanton wrote. “She’d rather we allow her to ‘focus on being a mom,’ stepping out only for special occasions like Easter in a designer outfit to deliver baskets to sick children.”“After more than a year watching her drift near the steps of one of the greatest platforms in the world, we still don’t know exactly what Melania Trump stands for,” Glanton wrote. “She has been so preoccupied shielding herself from her husband’s misdeeds that she has been unable to project her own identity.”“We do have the right to know whether she is still committed to her job,” Glanton concluded, adding that the public should give Trump a “loud wake-up call.”“She’s been sleeping on the job way too long,” Glanton wrote.As a woman who was thrust into the political world when her husband decided to run for president, Trump has not yet come forward with a formal platform as is the traditional course for first ladies.But in the 14 months since Donald Trump became the 45th president of the United States, Melania Trump has spoken often about her commitment to helping women, families, and children and has a list of accomplishments to that end, as Breitbart News has reported.In March 2017, Trump handed out awards at the annual International Women of Courage ceremony at the U.S. Department of State where she was introduced as a campaigner for the safety and security of women and girls around the world.“The era of allowing brutality against women and children is over,” Trump said to the large crowd of guests gathered to honor 13 women who faced horrific challenges in their lives but persisted to become activists to help others facing a similar plight.“Each one of these heroic women has an extraordinary story of courage, which should inspire each of us to achieve more than we had ever imagined possible,” Trump said before handing out statuettes and posing for pictures with each of the women.“Their lives remind us of the boundless capacity of the human spirit when guided by moral clarity and desire to do good,” Trump said.Trump also presented the 2018 courage awards last month at the State Department.“Courage is the quality most needed in this world, yet it is often the hardest to find,” Trump said. “Courage sets apart those who believe in a higher calling and those who act on it. It takes courage not only to see wrong but strive to right it. Courage is what sets apart the heroes from the rest; it is equal part bravery and nobility. The women of courage we honor here today are heroes.”In May 2017, Trump visited a children’s hospital in Rome where she met a young boy who had been waiting for a donor to be found for a heart transplant, and the first lady released a statement after she later heard good news about his fate.“Upon landing in Belgium, I learned a young boy and his family who had been waiting for a heart transplant was informed that the hospital has found a donor,” Melania said in a statement. “I read a book and held hands with this special little one just a few hours ago, and now my own heart is filled with joy over this news.”In September 2017, Trump spoke at the United Nations:“When we join together as parents caring for children, whether they live in our own families, across the street, across the nation, or across the globe, we claim our responsibility to the next generation to ensure they are prepared to accept the torch of leadership for the world of tomorrow,” the first lady said during her speech.“We must teach each child the values of empathy and communication,” she also said, adding that children “are the core of kindness, mindfulness, integrity, and leadership.”In October 2017, Trump traveled to Huntington, West Virginia, to visit a drug treatment center specializing in helping infants suffering from neonatal abstinence syndrome after being exposed to opioids while in their mother’s womb.Trump visited Lily’s Place, a non-profit drug treatment center for these infants.“The statistic that 40 percent of babies born addicted to drugs are put into foster care is one that Mrs. Trump would like to see lowered, and Lily’s Place was created with that in mind,” Stephanie Grisham, spokeswoman for the first lady, said in an interview with CNN.Last month, Trump met with representatives from tech giants in the United States about cyberbullying.The Washington Post first reported that Trump has invited “Amazon, Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Snap” as part of her “ongoing effort to have conversations about issues affecting children, including how they handle social media,” Grisham told CNN.And just ahead of Monday’s Easter Egg Roll at the White House, Melania Trump decided to put American students in the spotlight by asking one from each state to design an egg for the event rather than the professional designers that have traditionally contributed the eggs.Follow Penny Starr on Twitter."

The series was to be based on Peter Baker’s best-selling non-fiction book, The Breach: Inside the Impeachment and Trial of William Jefferson Clinton.Meanwhile, various studios are moving ahead with anti-President Donald Trump projects, some of which have already appeared before viewers.Netflix recently picked up the British-made documentary, Trump: An American Dream in which Trump is accused of working with the Mafia while building his real estate empire. That is only the first Netflix treatment of Trump. The outlet’s The Confidence Man, an episode of the documentary series entitled, Dirty Money, also treated viewers to a purported exposé of Trump’s business career.To be sure, there are many more anti-Trump screen projects in the works.CBS Films announced this week that it has purchased the rights to Michael Isikoff and David Corn’s “Russian Roulette,” the story of the Russian attempt to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.Hollywood’s reticence to foot projects based on Democrat scandals finds no parallels for fare about the Republican party. For decades, Hollywood has produced films and TV projects ridiculing such Republican figures as Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George W. Bush.In 2006, for instance, a movie entitled Death of a President debuted depicting the assassination of George W. Bush. The film was widely celebrated by liberals.For his part, President Ronald Regan has been the object of onscreen ridicule for decades. Indeed, just this year the Tom Cruise vehicle American Made fabricated history to implicate President Reagan and retry the Iran Contra scandal as it told the story of a CIA operative who flew drugs into the country supposedly on government-approved missions.In 2016 it was announced that a film would be produced to make fun of Reagan during his last two years in the White House as he began to suffer symptoms of the Alzheimer’s disease that finally took his life in 2004. The film was supposed to be a “comedy” depicting a president who had no idea where he was as he closed out his presidency. Actor Will Ferrell was said to be looking at taking the lead role, but the actor soon quit the production after a backlash ensued.Richard Nixon has been a target of liberal filmmakers for years. There was the 1999 film Dick, a comedy set during the Watergate Scandal, Oliver Stone’s 1995 screed Tricky Dicky, and many, many others too numerous to mention. Nixon is inevitably portrayed as an American monster, torn by his insecurities and unmindful of what is good for the country.Late night TV comedy show Saturday Night Live is a perfect microcosm of how the media has long-lambasted Republican presidents.Ultimately, films depicting Republicans as venal figures abound while projects that negatively portray Democrat politicians or scandals are far and few between, despite the rich well of possible historical plots and figures from which to choose.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston."

To say, ‘Here’s exactly what I think about America or guns or the military?'”Keith responded, “That’s a losing battle. You’re never gonna reach enough people in any interview to avoid being misrepresented.” He added a personal anecdote to make his point.The Times then nudged Keith a bit more to feel him out and finally asked what he would say if someone said, “Toby Keith, how do you justify gun rights in a world beset by mass shootings?”Keith responded:That’s one of those topics — and I’m not dodging the question — it’s one of those things we live with every day. It’s like one of the biggest struggles that I have on abortion is abortion. In my heart I don’t like it. But in my mind I agree with a lot of the situations where it should be. I understand [the well-being of] the mother.

I’m not that guy.The Times suggested people are not happy with anything less than a “firm answer,” and Keith explained that those who ask the question are only ready to hear one answer: “Whatever topic they come up with, they know how they want me to answer it. Whether they’re for it or against it or whether they believe like I do, they say, ‘I’m gonna ask this question because I think I know how he’ll answer it.’ And then when you don’t, they’re like, ‘What the hell?'”AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

For example, in a report by the Economic Policy Institute, between 2001 and 2015, about 3.4 million U.S. jobs were lost due to the country’s trade deficit with China.Of the 3.4 million U.S. jobs lost in that time period, about 2.6 million were lost in the crippled manufacturing industry, making up about three-fourths of the loss of jobs from the U.S.-Chinese trade deficit.The Atlas Free trade, like immigration, is an issue that has come at the expense of American workers.

China responded by threatening to slap tariffs on American aircraft and agricultural goods, targeting important sectors of the economy in “purple” states like Iowa that voted for Donald Trump in 2016.China had already slapped a 15% tariff on ethanol earlier in the week in response to the Trump administration’s new tariffs on steel and aluminum.In response to Chinese threats, Iowa’s senators pounced — on Trump.Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) said: “[F]armers and ranchers shouldn’t be expected to bear the brunt of retaliation for the entire country. The Administration knew that if it imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, China would retaliate against U.S. agriculture. I warned President Trump as much in a White House meeting in February. Today shows that’s exactly what happened.”Likewise, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) said: “The administration’s action could hurt global supply chains and may lead to higher consumer prices. Hardworking Iowans and American farmers and ranchers are already struggling to make ends meet.” While allowing that “[t]he President is right to increase pressure on China to change its ways,” Ernst admonished Trump to “reconsider these tariffs and pursue policies that enhance our competitiveness” instead.Other critics, like Charles Koch, made the case against the Trump administration’s policy by citing basic economic principles. “[T]he less trade we have the worse everybody is,” he said in an interview with the Washington Examiner. “I mean, the less exports we have the less imports we have and that makes us worse off. And the more we isolate ourselves, the less we learn of improvements and developments and innovations around the world.”Those arguments may all be true. And they are worth considering, and debating — in advance. But once the U.S. faces a trade war, those arguments become largely academic. Because as damaging as a trade war may be for all concerned, the worst possible outcome would be to surrender. If the Trump administration backs down under pressure from domestic interests, China will know that it can take advantage of us even more aggressively in future.The Chinese, as President Trump is fond of reminding us, are smart. They are gambling that their political system is stronger than ours. They hope that by hurting important political constituencies in a critical midterm election year, they can undermine President Trump’s domestic support and force him to surrender. They do not have the same problem in China: open political criticism is rare. The Communist Party is always right, and does what it wants.America has to rise to the challenge and unify against Chinese retaliation. Criticism is healthy, but right now the Ricardian law of comparative advantage is less important than Sun Tzu’s Art of War.Rather than debating how we reached this point, we should debate how best to achieve victory. Happily, there is consensus about what that would look like: we want China to follow the rules, respect our intellectual property, and stop dumping on our markets.William Galston, a liberal columnist for the Wall Street Journal, made two relevant observations recently. Last year, he noted that “China’s techno-nationalism …  poses the greatest threat to our future.” On Wednesday, he observed that our “worst enemy” is the “partisan rancor” that prevents us from uniting against common dangers.Free traders — myself included — will have our turn. But for now, the debate has changed. When in a trade war, we must win.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News. He was named to Forward’s 50 “most influential” Jews in 2017.

Another male also remains in custody for attempted murder— Tower Hamlets – Central East BCU (@MPSTowerHam) April 5, 2018Around an hour later at 6:57 p.m. police and paramedics were called to the stabbing of a 13-year-old boy, who is also currently in a “serious but stable” condition.Three “juvenile males” were subsequently arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm with intent — rather than attempted murder, for reasons which are unclear.Three juvenile males arrested on suspicion of GBH with intent after 13-year-old boy stabbed in Gainsborough Avenue, E12 near Little Ilford Park. His condition is serious but stable. Police were called along with @LDN_Ambulance at 1857hrs— Newham MPS (@MPSNewham) April 5, 2018Finally, the last known victim of the night’s violence was stabbed in Ealing Broadway, West London, at around 7 p.m. — a male said to be in his late teens.The spate of attacks comes as it emerges that the use of police stop-and-search powers is continuing to fall, with searches down 6 per cent on the same time last year, according to The Times.London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the fall in the use of stop-and-search since 2010 was “welcome” before he took office, and that he would “do everything in my power to bring it down further” — believing its use on ethnic minorities was problematic.Life hits you fast… pic.twitter.com/Y3rh1lytXj— Raheem 🇺🇸 (@RaheemKassam) April 5, 2018Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick recently admitted that constables may have become “fearful” of searching suspects as they “might get into trouble or might not be supported if they had a complaint”.Both she and Mayor Khan promised a u-turn on stop-and-search and a significant increase in its use after the crime wave began to slide out of control last year, and the news that it is, in fact, continuing to fall will be extremely damaging.Khan is already under fire for failing to speak to any of the families of recent murder victims, but has stuck to the Labour Party line of blaming Tory cuts for the crisis."
b'FARAGE: Political Correctness and \xe2\x80\x98Hate Crime\xe2\x80\x99 Obsession Caused Crime Wave',http://www.breitbart.com/london/2018/04/06/farage-political-correctness-hate-crime-obsession-crime-wave/,"He pointed to the police’s focus on ‘hate crime’ and the fact both London mayor Sadiq Khan and Prime Minister Theresa May, when serving as Home Secretary, promised to slash the use of police stop-and-search powers, claiming the tactic harmed relations with ethnic minorities.Speaking on his LBC radio show from Washington D.C., Mr. Farage said: “Theresa May was Home Secretary for a very long time, the longest-serving for 150 years.“She did in the early years have crime that was falling, which meant she felt more comfortable to cut back the size of the police force. But she very much introduced political correctness in policing.”Left-wing groups had campaigned against stop and search for years, claiming it is “racist”.Political correctness has directly led to @SadiqKhan's mess in London. Bring back stop and search. pic.twitter.com/rwmo2HhRAA— Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) April 5, 2018Sadiq Khan and current Home Secretary Amber Rudd both said they would reverse the policy of cutting back on stop-and-search as knife crime began to surge – jumping by 38 per cent in the capital recently.However, according to an analysis by The Times, the number of searches is actually still falling. London police carried out 19,931 in January and February this year; a fall of 6 per cent from the same period in 2017.Moving on to the new “hate crime” obsession, Mr. Farage added: “We now have 900 Metropolitan Police officers dealing with hate crime… Words can hurt people and upset people and make them feel excluded. But where are the priorities?”We have 900+ specialist officers across London dedicated to investigating all hate crime.

Some police forces even include “unfriendliness” as an indicator of “hate”."
b'Sweden Saw Biggest Ever Increase in Gonorrhoea Cases in 2017',http://www.breitbart.com/london/2018/04/06/despite-having-nearly-eradicated-the-disease-sweden-saw-biggest-ever-increase-in-gonorrhoea-cases-in-2017/,"There were some 2,550 new cases in 2015, a 44 per cent rise from the already historically-high 1,778 cases 2016 reports Sweden Television (SVT). Earlier reports stated the number of people who sought treatment for gonorrhoea in the early part of 2017 was already three times higher than the same period in 2016.While rates of infection with the disease were traditionally broadly similar between straight men, women, and gay men, what the Swedish Public Health Authority classifies as MSM — men who have sex with men — have seen a rapid rise in the past five years. In 2017 the number of cases among the gay community increased 59 per cent — well above the national average.The spread of the disease has impacted disproportionately on certain areas. In the national capital of Stockholm, the prevalence of the disease is now 63 cases per 100,000 inhabitants — significantly ahead of the national rate of 25 cases per 100,000.Speaking to SVT, Anders Tegnell, state epidemiologist at the Public Health Authority said of the rise: “Gonorrhea had almost disappeared completely in Sweden, but unfortunately we are seeing an increase again. The increase is mainly in the group of men who have sex with men, but we also see an increase in other groups.“The reason for spreading is hard to know, but there are obvious connections to how individuals assess risks and how important it is with condom use”.Migrant Who Frequently Visited Kindergarten May Have Given Children Tuberculosishttps://t.co/LemK1fpyXB— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 22, 2017Gonorrhoea is not the only disease thought to have been brought under control by European health authorities which has made a sudden comeback in recent years. Breitbart London reported in 2016 on the revival of long-eradicated diseases in Germany and Denmark, including Tuberculosis and Diphtheria, which were recorded among incoming migrants arriving as part of the Europe migrant crisis.The sudden arrival of large numbers of people with complex healthcare needs placed a huge strain on European healthcare systems, it was reported, with the migrant crisis becoming a public health crisis of its own.The Swedish authorities have not indicated a link between migrants and the increase in gonorrhoea, however."
b'Failed Pakistani Asylum Seeker \xe2\x80\x98Slit Daughter\xe2\x80\x99s Throat to Punish Wife\xe2\x80\x99',http://www.breitbart.com/london/2018/04/06/germany-failed-pakistani-asylum-seeker-slit-daughter-throat-punish-wife/,"Sohail A., 34, began his trial in a Hamburg court this Wednesday, accused of violently terrorising his wife, 32, and their two children before allegedly killing his tiny daughter Ayesha in October last year.The couple was married according to Shariah and the union is not recognised under German law, the Hamburger Morgenpost reports.According to the indictment, Sohail was angered because his wife did not want her daughter returned to Pakistan, and when she left to report him for making death threats, he killed their daughter in a fit of rage.The prosecution also accuses Sohail of several attacks on his five-year-old stepson, including throttling him, as well as beating his partner, in the years before the killing.Sohail’s defence lawyer read a statement to the court on Wednesday morning, admitting the killing but denying the alleged motive.Sohail was in Germany despite his asylum application having been rejected six years ago.His asylum request was rejected in 2012, but he was never deported. https://t.co/y00dM6PrcJ— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 27, 2017His statement said: “The prosecution’s assumption that I acted out of anger over my wife and out of revenge is wrong. I was desperate, the situation seemed hopeless, everything seemed to break down around me.“I loved my daughter above all else. It is inconceivable for me to live without them, I blame myself.”Sohail reportedly arrived in Germany in 2011, staying in Hamburg before fleeing the city after killing his daughter.He was finally tracked down in northern Spain, where he was arrested at a friend’s house after applying for a new Pakistani passport so he could return to his native country.Court papers reveal he killed his daughter “by almost completely separating the child’s head from her body”.The wife is due to testify to the court via a video link this Friday, so she does not have to share a room with Sohail again. The trial continues."

One asylum seeker lashed out at Europeans in general, blaming European countries for the situation in his native Nigeria and demanding a job and a place to live.The Canal Saint-Martin also houses another makeshift tent camp of around 400 Afghan nationals. A total of 920 tents housing around 1,885 people were recently counted by the asylum organisation France Terre d’Asile.Hundreds of Migrants Pitch Tents on Paris Streets as Calais Camp Shuts – https://t.co/JvYe2iT0Zr pic.twitter.com/VRoVKURuL2— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 30, 2016The migrant camps have affected the city in a number of ways, including leading to the closure of the art museum Art Ludique which featured “pop art” including cartoon and comic book works. The presence of migrants near the museum led to a rapid drop in visitors and a subsequent decline in revenue needed to keep the museum open.Roving gangs of underage Moroccan migrants have also become a major problem in the north of Paris, leading to 1,600 local residents signing a petition demanding the government deal with the problem. Both residents and local business owners complained of targetted attacks and thefts from the migrant children.The homeless migrants are still a small fraction of the total number of asylum seekers in France,  with the country seeing a record 100,000 asylum applications in 2017."

Instead, we call for a renewed focus by all parties on finding solutions to the dire humanitarian challenges facing Gazans.”Read more here."
