b'Mark Zuckerberg Proposes Facebook \xe2\x80\x98Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99 to Rule on \xe2\x80\x98Hate Speech\xe2\x80\x99',http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/04/02/mark-zuckerberg-proposes-facebook-supreme-court-to-rule-on-hate-speech/,"In an interview with Vox.com Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined the future of the social media platform, at one point suggesting that a “Supreme Court” model could be used when judging what counts as hate speech on the platform. As the company reels from their latest user data scandal — which saw stock prices plummet — and a market value loss of approximately $100 billion, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been attempting to open discussion about how Facebook can improve.Zuckerberg was asked about the site’s governance structure and the general lack of oversight of the company. Ezra Klein noted that there was no “quadrennial election for CEO of Facebook,” which may lead to a lack of accountability for the company. Zuckerberg responded to this by outlining Facebook’s supposed principles; “Here are a few of the principles. One is transparency,” said Zuckerberg. “Right now, I don’t think we are transparent enough around the prevalence of different issues on the platform. We haven’t done a good job of publishing and being transparent about the prevalence of those kinds of issues, and the work that we’re doing and the trends of how we’re driving those things down over time.”The Facebook CEO then discussed the lack of accountability for Facebook’s moderation team who decide what content should be allowed on the platform. “A second is some sort of independent appeal process. Right now, if you post something on Facebook and someone reports it and our Community Operations and Review Team looks at it and decides that it needs to get taken down, there’s not really a way to appeal that. I think in any kind of good-functioning democratic system, there needs to be a way to appeal. And I think we can build that internally as a first step.”Zuckerberg’s solution? A Facebook hate speech “Supreme Court.” Zuckerberg stated “What I’d really like to get to is an independent appeal. So maybe folks at Facebook make the first decision based on the community standards that are outlined, and then people can get a second opinion. You can imagine some sort of structure, almost like a Supreme Court, that is made up of independent folks who don’t work for Facebook, who ultimately make the final judgment call on what should be acceptable speech in a community that reflects the social norms and values of people all around the world.”Given Facebook’s history of banning conservatives and various other users and pages for very little reason, an appeals process may not be the worst idea. Whether or not Facebook will bother to go to the effort of implementing such a system is yet to be seen. On the other hand, the Silicon Valley Masters of the Universe have a history of creating “independent” bodies that are staffed almost exclusively by progressives. For example, the Twitter “Trust and Safety Council” whose membership includes notorious feminist Anita Sarkeesian."
b'Masters of the Universe Infighting: Zuckerberg Calls Apple CEO\xe2\x80\x99s Arguments \xe2\x80\x98Glib\xe2\x80\x99',http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/04/02/masters-of-the-universe-infighting-zuckerberg-calls-apple-ceos-arguments-glib/,"In an interview with Vox, Zuckerberg was asked to address Cook’s contention that Apple has a better business model, based on selling products to users rather than selling user data to third parties.“You know, I find that argument, that if you’re not paying that somehow we can’t care about you, to be extremely glib” said Zuckerberg.“The reality here is that if you want to build a service that helps connect everyone in the world, then there are a lot of people who can’t afford to pay. And therefore, as with a lot of media, having an advertising-supported model is the only rational model that can support building this service to reach people.”“But if you want to build a service which is not just serving rich people, then you need to have something that people can afford. I thought Jeff Bezos had an excellent saying on this in one of his Kindle launches a number of years back. He said, “There are companies that work hard to charge you more, and there are companies that work hard to charge you less.” And at Facebook, we are squarely in the camp of the companies that work hard to charge you less and provide a free service that everyone can use.”Zuckerberg’s comments were in response to repeated criticism from Apple CEO Tim Cook, who has attacked the Facebook CEO for allowing the social network’s ongoing data scandal to happen.“The truth is, we could make a ton of money if we monetized our customer — if our customer was our product. We’ve elected not to do that” said Cook in an interview last week.“The ability of anyone to know what you’ve been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike, and every intimate detail of your life – from my point of view, it shouldn’t exist.”Allum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News.

"b'NYT on the Masters of the Universe: \xe2\x80\x98They Tried to Boycott Facebook, Apple and Google. They Failed.\xe2\x80\x99'",http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/04/02/nyt-on-the-masters-of-the-universe-they-tried-to-boycott-facebook-apple-and-google-they-failed/,"The article published in the New York Times is titled “They Tried to Boycott Facebook, Apple and Google. They Failed,” and describes just how hard it is to organize boycotts against tech corporations that have become so heavily ingrained in people’s everyday lives. The Times uses an ironic tweet as their first example of how hard it is for activists to take a stand against companies they oppose while still using their devices and platforms;Ryan Knight, a Democratic activist in Los Angeles, called for a boycott of Apple in February because it hadn’t responded to calls to delete a channel from the National Rifle Association from its streaming-video service after the Parkland, Fla., school shooting.“Dear @Apple,” Mr. Knight wrote on Twitter. “Your silence is deafening. #BoycottApple.” More than 330 accounts retweeted the message.How did Mr. Knight post the message? He used an iPhone.The Times also noted that those attempting to boycott Google have faced similar problems;People looking to punish major tech companies by abstaining from their products have been bedeviled time and again by the difficulty in escaping them. After Google fired an engineer, James Damore, for criticizing the company’s diversity efforts last year, hundreds of people on social media called for a boycott of the company. But an analysis of nearly 7,000 tweets using the hashtag #BoycottGoogle since August showed that 26 percent of the tweets came from devices using Google’s Android software, according to Keyhole, a social-media research firm.One Twitter account named Milton Prescott tweeted on Aug. 8: “Google’s firing of James Damore proves his point completely. I will no longer be using Google for any services. #BoycottGoogle.” The tweet came from an Android device. A message to the account went unreturned.And as these digital giants continue to expand their influence into the real world, it’s beginning to become harder for consumers to understand exactly where their money is going;Marisa Richardson, a program manager at a life-sciences company, said she began boycotting Amazon recently after learning that it offered the NRA channel on its streaming-video service. So when she needed laundry detergent, she avoided the e-commerce site and instead braved the crowds and traffic — and spent a few dollars more — at a nearby Target.But a few days later she shopped at the Whole Foods near her home in Oakland, Calif. “I completely forgot that they’re owned by Amazon,” she said.After the shooting in Parkland in February, gun-control activists called for a boycott of certain Apple and Amazon services because they hosted the NRA channel.People used the hashtag #March1NRABoycott to spread the message on social media. An analysis of about 58,500 tweets with the hashtag showed that nearly half came from an iPhone or an iPad, according to Keyhole. Those included popular tweets using the #March1NRABoycott hashtag from the actress Alyssa Milano.“Had I sent the same tweets from an Android phone, the same issue would apply. There is an NRATV app for Android phones,” Ms. Milano said through a spokeswoman. “We are only just beginning to understand how these companies have infiltrated not only our ideologies, but also our lives in the most in-depth way imaginable.”Read the full article in the New York Times here."

Amazon Web Services, which holds a dominant 44 percent of the cloud market, is in prime position to receive the multi-year contract.This is despite the fact that Trump is no fan of the company, and has repeatedly attacked it and its founder, Jeff Bezos. The president recently called out the company for hurting the jobs market and the Post Office, and called on the Bezos-owned Washington Post to register as a lobbying organization.I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election. Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2018While we are on the subject, it is reported that the U.S. Post Office will lose $1.50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon. That amounts to Billions of Dollars. The Failing N.Y. Times reports that “the size of the company’s lobbying staff has ballooned,” and that…— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 31, 2018…does not include the Fake Washington Post, which is used as a “lobbyist” and should so  REGISTER. If the P.O. “increased its parcel rates, Amazon’s shipping costs would rise by $2.6 Billion.” This Post Office scam must stop. Amazon must pay real costs (and taxes) now!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 31, 2018The Pentagon’s decision to award its cloud computing contract, potentially worth billions of dollars, to just one company has come under fire.“Having multiple cloud providers also insulates you against risk” said the president of the Coalition for Government Procurement, Roger Waldron. “If you are dependent on one cloud provider for ten years, if something goes wrong, what are you going to do?”The Coalition for Government Procurement represents a number of defense contractors, including Amazon competitors IBM, Microsoft, and Oracle.House Appropriations Committee spokeswoman Jennifer Hing questioned the combination of a single-vendor contract with a long duration.“The Committee has concerns about any contract that limits commercial competition by locking the Department into 10-year contracts with no exit strategy.”Allum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News.

Did one of his affairs connect him with the mob? #TheKennedys Sunday at 9p on CNN. pic.twitter.com/HoxHQVSCmT— CNN Original Series (@CNNOriginals) March 31, 2018Fox News reports that CNN promoted its documentary The Kennedy’s by “hail[ing] the 35th president’s ‘legendary love life,’ before asking, ‘Did one of his affairs connect him with the mob?'”Obviously, the far-left cable channel is once again revealing its partisan double standard.Twenty-five years ago, CNN worked overtime to earn the nickname “Clinton News Network” over its zealous defense of former-President Bill Clinton during the many sex scandals that exploded during his time in office. Clinton had an affair in the Oval Office with a 22-year-old subordinate and was credibly accused of everything from groping to rape.Clinton also settled a sexual harassment lawsuit for $850,000 after Paula Jones accused him  of flashing her.Nevertheless, CNN was there to dismiss every accusation and to advance the administration’s personal attacks against his accusers.John Kennedy also had countless adulterous affairs while president, numerous reports say this included a mobster’s girlfriend and Marilyn Monroe, who he reportedly passed off to his brother, Attorney general Bobby Kennedy. Many believe her treatment at the hands of the Kennedy brothers led Monroe to suicide in 1962 at age 36.There are also reports that John Kennedy was a “predator president” who ordered a 19-year-old intern (he had already deflowered in his wife’s White House bedroom) to give his assistant oral sex.For CNN to glorify this kind of compromising, predatory, and destructive behavior “legendary” is something the far-left cable network would only do for a Democrat.A possible one night stand 12 years ago does not even begin to compare with the reckless and immoral behavior of both Clinton and Kennedy, yet the basement-rated place cable channel seeks to protect both Democrats while at the same time seeking to destroy Trump over something that may or may not have happened more than a decade ago.CNN is facing widespread ridicule and criticism over its shameless Kennedy/Trump double standard, which again shows that this last-place news network remains a laughingstock that no one can or should take seriously. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

I mean, if God knocked up my wife, He’d never doink again. I’d cut off God’s penis,” Trump says.Vice President Mike Pence warns the president, ” Sir, I think that’s a hot mic.”Trump does not believe him, and the anti-Christian insults continue: “You think your great-grandfather hunted dinosaurs. How do grown adults still worship Jesus? I mean, where was Jesus when the Taj Mahal was at a standstill with the unions?”:After the gaffe hits the news, Trump tells the public, “Don’t believe the dishonest media.

b'Baseball Viewership Hits Lowest Mark in a Decade',http://www.breitbart.com/sports/2018/04/02/baseball-viewership-hits-lowest-mark-decade/,"According to the poll, a mere 44 percent say they watch the game, while 56 percent said they do not. Those numbers represent the lowest viewership percentages for “America’s Pastime,” since 2009.As Paul Bedard writes in the Washington Examiner, it’s not just the American public that seems to have lost interest in the game.“So far, Trump hasn’t joined in the practice of presidents throwing out the first pitch on opening day, started by William Howard Taft in 1912. Only one president since then, Jimmy Carter, didn’t participate.”While the declining numbers in raw viewership are bad enough for baseball, the problem gets worse when you consider that MLB has taken its biggest fan losses among younger viewers.According to the poll, “Older Americans (51 percent of those age 45 or older) are more likely than younger Americans (37 percent of those under the age of 45) to say they are baseball fans.”The problem this poses for baseball in particular, cannot be understated. Unlike more action-packed, less expensive sports like football and basketball, many children get involved in baseball because their fathers and older brothers played, or were fans of the game. If the younger generation isn’t watching, who is going to teach their kids about the game?In addition, the sport has also become more regional. According to Marist, a small majority of baseball fans live in the Northeast and Midwest. But only 39 percent of those in the South and West called themselves baseball fans.Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn"

They must stop them at their Northern Border, which they can do because their border laws work, not allow them to pass through into our country, which has no effective border laws…..— Donald J.

b'Democratic Activist: Keep Border Open Until Trump OKs Amnesty',http://www.breitbart.com/2018-elections/2018/04/02/democrat-keep-open-border-until-trump-oks-amnesty/,"The open borders plan came from Leon Fresco, an immigration activist now working in D.C. for foreign clients, including tens of thousands of Indian tech-workers. In 2013, Fresco was Schumer’s Democrats’ chief immigration lawyer as they wrote up the disastrous “Gang of Eight” amnesty bill which prompted the public to elect pro-American Donald Trump in 2016. Fresco Tweeted April 1:Any admin changes for border surge will be blocked by Courts, and Congress will not enact a 1-sided solution on enforcement … Congress will not pass enforcement-only bill. Such efforts will be tried and will fail. At that point, CIR-type [Comprehensive Immigration Reform] bill possible.Fresco made his claim after Trump used Twitter to slam the Mexican government for refusing to stop a march of 1,000-plus central America migrants towards Texas, and to slam the Democratic Party for refusing to close the legal loopholes — including “catch and release” — which allowed at least 400,000 Central Americans migrants into the United States during former President Barack Obama’s eight years in office.Until Sunday, Trump had offered to approve an amnesty for at least 1.8 million illegals in exchange for closing those loopholes, ending the visa lottery, winding down chain migration and building the border wall. Schumer’s Democratic Senators — and at least ten business-first Republicans — rejected that compromise in a February 15 Senate vote.Trump Tweeted Sunday:Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch & Release. Getting more dangerous. “Caravans” coming. Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 1, 2018Fresco responded via Twitter by saying the courts will use the existing laws to keep the border topen for the migrants, and Democrats will block any upgraded border laws until Trump agrees to “Comprehensive Immigration Reform,” which is a Democratic euphemism for a massive amnesty.“What POTUS will find after today’s tweets is that any admin changes for border surge will be blocked by Courts, and Congress will not enact a 1-sided solution on enforcement. Even though POTUS currently says “no deal,” the chances for [an amnesty] deal now higher.If border surge happens this spring, POTUS has limited options. Courts blocked everything Obama did to stop 2014 surge. POTUS needs Congress [to get around courts]. But Congress will not pass enforcement-only bill. Such efforts will be tried and will fail. At that point, CIR-type [Comprehensive Immigration Reform] bill possible.and by CIR-type bill, I am just saying that DACA alone for what is needed on the border will likely not be supported by Dems. That type of trade will only work in something larger (and that something larger would, of course, need to include backlog relief). All will depend on..…Whether POTUS wants to pass laws to provide more authority to address illegal immigration or whether he thinks he can survive a border surge by simply blaming Dems. We will all find out together.Fresco’s threat comes as a group of more than 1,000 Central Americans, mostly young men, is collectively marching through Mexico to ask for asylum at the Texas border. They are expected to arrive late March, unless the Mexican government sees an incentive to stop them.My first dispatch while on the trail with hundreds of Central Americans who have boldly crossed immigration check points, military bases, & police in a desperate, sometimes chaotic march toward the US https://t.co/cf2rnzbp3n— Adolfo Flores (@aflores) March 30, 2018Beautiful: Immigration agents abandoned their posts as 1,500 people on Refugee Caravan, mainly from Honduras, crossed into Mexico from Guatemala yesterday with goal to reach US (video via @pueblosf) pic.twitter.com/QsduFwN747— Scott Campbell (@incandesceinto) March 26, 2018Fresco’s threats rest on the courts’ continued backing for the claim that current laws require the border patrol to allow almost anyone into the country to apply for legal asylum if they claim to have a “credible fear” of persecution or torture.Obama’s interpretation of the law laid out a welcome mat for migrants, especially because his policy also allowed migrants into freely enter the United States — and get work permits — once the number of admittees exceeds the total number of detention-beds funded by Congress. In fact, Obama let so many migrants into the United States that he backlogged the asylum courts, so giving the migrants several years to find valid legal arguments to stay in the United States.Similarly, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2008 was interpreted by Obama’s deputies to require that people who claim to be children should also be allowed into the United States. That loophole was used by many young Central American men — and by many MS-13 gang members to get into the United States.The Democrats’ opposition to a border-loophole reform was underlined on January 16 by Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, who suggested to DHS chief Kirstjen Nielsen that Trump’s legal reforms could kill many innocent young women:One of the things on your must-have list, which you passed out on Tuesday and brought to us again today in a different form, relates to asylum protection. and you use the example of a child at the border of being coached, to use the words “credible fear” and that triggers a certain reaction. But I would like to call your attention to something that I hope can add another perspective. It’s an article entitled “When Deportation Is a Death Sentence,” written by Sara Stillman, published in the New Yorker. I want you to read it. I hope you’ll read it. It talks about what happens when the agents who are involved in this don’t ask the right question, don’t hear the answer, and send many women back to their death.Fresco’s hard-nosed tactics spotlight the Democrats’ determination to advance their political goals via immigration, despite the huge impact on blue-collar Americans.For example, on February 15, Democrats back a proposal by main GOP Sen. Susan Collins that would have established a double-amnesty — a “prioritization amnesty” for roughly 8 million illegals working for Americans companies, and a formal amnesty for at least 1.8 million younger illegals — in exchange for creating a fund of $25 billion for wall construction. However, that fund was surrounded by bureaucratic and legal barriers, and would not have fixed any of the legal loopholes used by migrants to walk through the wall.Four million Americans turn 18 each year and begin looking for good jobs in the free market.But the federal government inflates the supply of new labor by annually accepting roughly 1.1 million new legal immigrants, by providing work-permits to roughly 3 million resident foreigners, and by doing little to block the employment of roughly 8 million illegal immigrants.The Washington-imposed economic policy of economic growth via mass-immigration floods the market with foreign labor, spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids’ schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions. "
b'Border Patrol Agents Helping Families Identify Remains of Deceased Migrants',http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2018/03/31/border-patrol-agents-helping-families-identify-remains-deceased-migrants/,"The Border Patrol agents worked with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials, the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office (MCSO) and the Border Action Network to assist families who lost loved ones who went missing after crossing the border into the desert region of southern Arizona. The “Missing in Arizona” event took place in Phoenix on Tuesday as a follow-up to last October’s event, CBP officials stated.Officials collect DNA sample to help identify missing migrants’ remains. (Photo: U.S. Customs and Border Protection)Law enforcement officials collected DNA samples from the families. The samples will be used by officials to cross-check the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUS) to try and match samples taken from unidentified remains. The Missing Migrant Program also works with other law enforcement agencies, third-party reporting entities, foreign consulates, and other non-governmental organizations in thier effort to reunite families and help those who lost loved-ones find closure.CBP officials stated they received more than 1,500 requests for assistance from families of missing migrants during the last fiscal year that ended in October.During the first two months of this year, agents recovered the remains of 12 illegal immigrants who died in southern Arizona, Breitbart Texas reported.All of the migrants are unidentified as their remains had decomposed by the time of discovery. This makes determining the identity of the deceased, their nation of origin, and the time and manner of death difficult to determine, Pima County Medical Examiner Dr. Gregory Hess told Breitbart Texas in an interview earlier this month.“We have been experiencing this problem for a very long time,” Dr. Hess explained. “When the migrants decide to attempt to walk through the desert, there is not much margin for error. If something goes wrong, it can certainly be very dangerous.”His office processes the remains of about 160 deceased migrants each year.Pima County Sheriff Mark Napier told Breitbart Texas, “Open borders policies are not compassionate public policy, When we passively encourage illegal border crossing we are creating a human rights tragedy. These migrants are victimized repeatedly by bandits, human smuggling coyotes, and the harsh elements of this region.”Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

You say about daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, you call them Teflon aides. You write — quote — “In the end, Jared and Ivanka would push the most disastrous and foolish decisions of Trump’s presidency. They had no understanding of how the basic fundamentals of how government works, how a campaign works, how politics works.

It brought in the special counsel, Mueller.TAPPER: Why did — why did they do that? Why did Jared Kushner push that?KESSLER: Jared said, well, Democrats will love this. This was a political move. And, of course, it turned out not to be true at all. In addition, they pushed hiring Anthony Scaramucci, who had to be the most absurd hire in the history of the White House. So, Donald Trump understands that they are problems, has said to them, maybe you should go back to New York, implied that he really didn’t want them. But he doesn’t fire people.

b'Wasinger: Ben Carson\xe2\x80\x99s Quiet but Effective Reforms',http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/04/01/wasinger-ben-carsons-quiet-effective-reforms/,"Often, that has taken the form of attacks directed at members of the president’s cabinet with trumped-up (so to speak) charges of malfeasance. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson has, of late, been on the receiving end of such attacks, with many of the president’s enemies calling for his removal over allowing the purchase of higher-end furniture for the secretary’s suite.In Carson’s case, the media campaign to force his ouster (which has died down in the wake of Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin’s removal this week), is almost certainly driven by his effectiveness in faithfully executing his duties and instituting the reforms promised by the president. The fact that he has carried out one of the more effective top-down reviews of a federal agency in recent history has also made him a target of the reflexively pro-government progressive crowd who have never met a regulation they didn’t like.Carson has not gotten the credit he deserves, not only for his service to his country — service that comes at great personal sacrifice — but for his bold, reform-minded approach to an agency many think should be eliminated. In recent weeks, Secretary Carson has been working on a rent reform proposal designed to incentivize self-sufficiency by introducing work requirements and raising rents for tenants able to work who receive subsidies from HUD. These common sense reforms, hardly draconian, will save millions in taxpayer dollars, but face stiff opposition from those who view the dependent poor as a more reliable voting block than a struggling, but upwardly mobile, lower-middle class.Secretary Carson has also put together a task force led by his chief financial officer with the aim of combating waste, fraud, and abuse. A lot of contractors, developers, and grant recipients of HUD-sponsored contracts — many of whom epitomize the revolving door phenomenon of former federal government employees using their connections to cash out with sweetheart deals — never complete the work they were tasked with or for which the grant was awarded. Secretary Carson’s new task force will start eliminating fraud in the arena of contracts and grants, saving countless millions in the process.But perhaps the real gem in Secretary Carson’s reform efforts is taking another look at the so-called, “Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing” initiative that is based on a rule by President Obama’s HUD called “disparate impact.” Disparate impact tells communities that even if there are no complaints of discrimination in a city, there can still be racism if not enough minorities are living in more affluent areas of the community. As a result, HUD under the Obama administration forced communities to assess this “disparate impact” racism and alleviate it by building projects in higher income areas. A more blatant example of harmful regulatory overreach and bureaucratic arrogance does not exist. Secretary Carson’s pending decision on how to handle the “disparate impact rule” could set the stage for a politically significant, and symbolically important, frontal attack on liberal social engineering at HUD that would have a massive political windfall.As long as Ben Carson remains one of the most effective opponents of the regulatory regime in this administration, he will be a target of the pro-government Left. He should wear that as a badge of honor.Robert Wasinger served in senior advisory and liaison roles in President Donald Trump‘s campaign and transition team, after extensive experience on Capitol Hill."

You’ve been on record in the past saying that President Trump should not pardon Michael Flynn. Do you view Paul Manafort differently?SCOTT: I do not. I think it’s important that the White House be clear on this position as it relates to not treating either person differently. The fact of the matter is keeping the pardon off the table is a necessary part of the process. I would be disappointed if President Trump were to pardon either one of these individuals. The good news is that the Mueller investigation continues. The better news is that the public will have as much information as necessary to draw clear conclusions. And today, it only reinforces why it’s important for us to make sure that the investigation continues until it gets to the end. I hope that we get there sooner than later. But the reality of it is that the more information we find out, the better, and the more confident the American people will be in who we are as a nation.BRENNAN: Does that mean you would support legislation to protect Bob Mueller from being fired?SCOTT: I don’t know that we need legislation to move forward.

(KRISTINA WONG/BREITBART NEWS)In March, Breitbart News and several other U.S. journalists were invited by the Pakistan government to view the port, and other signs of the country’s economic progress.“We are twin brothers,” said Dostain Khan Jamaldini, chairman of the Gwadar Port Authority, of his Chinese counterpart, Zhang Baozhong, chairman and CEO of China Overseas Ports Holding Company Ltd.The port and four square miles of land have been leased to China until 2059, to set up tax-free businesses and build an economic free zone.It’s not just the port that China has helped build in Gwadar. There is also a lavish business center nearby. The white marble-floored lobby features a giant map of the world — minus the Americas — with China and Pakistan highlighted in red and black respectively.The center was built in five-and-a-half months by Chinese foremen, Pakistani engineers, and with millions of dollars of Chinese investment.There’s also a vocational training center, a 300-bed hospital, and a school. There are plans to build an international airport and a power plant.Pakistan and China hope to set up an economic free zone in Gwadar. (KRISTINA WONG/BREITBART NEWS)The projects are part of Pakistan and China’s $46 billion plan to develop a land corridor from the western China, down through Pakistan, and all the way to the Arabian Sea, known as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC.Pakistan’s leaders are hoping CPEC will transform Pakistan’s economy into a regional trade hub, create some 700,000 jobs, and boost its growth rate. So far, 55 CPEC projects have been completed, ranging from energy, infrastructure, agriculture, and tourism.The plan appears to be having some effect. Two years ago, there were two flights a week from Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city, to Gwadar. Now, there are two flights a day, according to Zhang.This is happening while U.S. and Pakistan have hit a rough spot in their relationship.In January, President Trump cut security assistance to Pakistan by more than $300 million, and tweeted on New Year’s Day, “The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools. They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!”The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools. They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 1, 2018The cutting of aid is part of the administration’s plan to increase pressure on Pakistan to stop providing safe haven for the Taliban and other terrorists engaged in the Afghanistan War. U.S. officials blame Pakistan for allowing terrorists to launch attacks in Afghanistan and escape into its borders.Pakistan officials say they are not providing safe haven to terrorists, and argue they have limited reach in the semi-autonomous border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan. They also point to a major counterterrorism operation they have been waging against terrorists since 2014, and say they are going after those who attack in Afghanistan and Pakistan.Both sides acknowledge the relationship is strained. Against this backdrop, some Pakistani officials see China as a potential alternative partner, and a closer relationship with China as a potential counterbalance to the U.S.’s growing relationship with their regional rival India.“You kick me, you push me out of the room. Where do I go?” said a senior Pakistan official who spoke to reporters on background. “So more than we going to China, I think U.S. is pushing us faster, harder because we are children of lesser god. That is how U.S. can treat its lifelong ally.”China appears to be taking advantage of Pakistani grievances.Zhang, dressed entirely in Pakistani local attire, said he is not a politician but talks in platitudes that exhibit China’s soft power approach to its partners. He said the Chinese and Pakistanis have a lot in common. Both, he said, “are humble, hardworking, and peace-loving people.”“We feel our culture is very similar to Pakistani culture. We believe it is our duty, that we should help Pakistan,” he said. “Pakistan really sacrifice a lot because of terrorism. Poverty is the root of terrorism,” he said. “If people enjoy good life, why they go to terrorism?”He compared Pakistan to a “good boy” who does “good things” and should not be punished. “You have to encourage them in the right direction,” he added.The new alliance between Pakistan and China is evident everywhere. (KRISTINA WONG/BREITBART NEWS)Of course, the projects are more than just good will for China.CPEC is also a key part of China’s overarching plan, called the “One Belt One Road” initiative, to build multiple land routes from China throughout the Eastern hemisphere, and at the same time, a “Maritime Silk Road” from Southeast Asian to the Mediterranean Sea. The two would link at Gwadar Port.CPEC would also give China, now the world’s largest oil importer, a shorter and cheaper route to the Middle East. The current routes, through the Sea of Malacca and the South China Sea, are almost twice as long and vulnerable to interruption by foreign navies.Gwadar Port sits in the strategically significant Arabian Sea, near the mouth of the oil-rich Persian Gulf.CPEC will also link China’s underdeveloped west to the Gwadar Port. And the port could also give China a potential military naval base in the future, although Zhang laughed when asked if there were any Chinese military ships at the port.CPEC will also link China’s underdeveloped west to the Gwadar Port. (KRISTINA WONG/BREITBART NEWS)The growing ties between China and Pakistan have not escaped Washington’s attention.The congressionally-appointed U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission held a hearing in January on the One Belt One Road initiative, a portion of which discussed China’s growing ties with Pakistan and implications for the U.S.“We will have to deal with the fact that greater Chinese presence is going to be a fact rather than expecting that we’re always going to be able to counter it,,” Andrew Small, Senior Transatlantic Fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, testified.Some Pakistani officials feel caught in the middle.“Now, in our region, we feel that great power rivalry has been aggravated in Asia,” said the senior Pakistan official. “Why is the U.S. doing this? Declaring China and Russia as revisionist states? Making it public? Why do you want to create enemy? Why do you want to compete? Why can’t you cooperate?”Others favor turning to China.“There is a big transformation taking place,” said Sen. Mushahid Hussain Sayed, chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Defence. A calendar from China featuring Chinese President Xi Jinping sat on his desk. “The U.S. is losing clout.”Sen. Mushahid Hussain Sayed, chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Defence. (KRISTINA WONG/BREITBART NEWS)Despite the increasing ties with China, most Pakistani officials hope the relationship with the U.S. will improve. There is also some trepidation over putting all their “eggs in the Chinese basket,” according to one Pakistan expert who spoke to reporters on background.China helped Sri Lanka build a port, but when the country could not repay Chinese loans, it was forced to lease the port to China for an excessive 99-year term.There are some risks for the Chinese as well. Pakistan will need to prove the security situation has improved before international investors feel comfortable investing. Pakistani officials say the security situation has improved in the last few years.Indeed, the South Asia Terrorism Portal shows that deaths caused by terrorism have decreased since 2014, after the country began cracking down on terrorists in Operation Zarb-e-Azb. However, in May 2017, two Chinese citizens were abducted and later killed in Quetta, Baluchistan.Zhang said so far, security in Gwadar has been fine. He said he relies entirely on Pakistan for security. “They give me protection. I make an investment,” he said.To date, there have been investors from Malaysia, Tunisia, Indonesia, Singapore, and Saudi Arabia in Gwadar. Zhang encouraged the U.S. to invest in Gwadar as well. “Bring a brand. Bring one good brand,” he said. "

While admitting that some Hispanics and Muslims are bad people, Barkley insisted that most are good, hard-working people. “The President has done an awful job of trying to be inclusive,” Barkley said.Indeed, Barkley hinted that he thinks Trump’s followers are the ones who won’t take responsibility for their own troubles in life. The TNT sports host told Axelrod that Trump’s supporters are people “who just won’t look in a mirror and say ‘my life sucks because of me.'”Barkley also insisted that only “the rich” can get ahead in the U.S. today.“(We’ve) got the worst public school system in the world. People talk about economic opportunity; there’s only economic opportunity if you’re rich,” Barkley scoffed.“I want everybody to have a good job, I want their kids to go to school, I want their kids to be safe.

Ingraham went on the attack against several figures in professional sports in a February commentary where she insisted they are losing fans by getting political and speaking on issues about which they know nothing.“She’s tried calling out people at Dartmouth University for their sexual orientation and she told Lebron James to shut up and dribble,” Hogg said. “I don’t see any apology for those people.”Hogg told CNN that it is “disturbing” that Ingraham has not been held to account for her past sins of criticizing other liberals.“It’s really sad, it’s disturbing to know that somebody can bully so many people and just get away with it, especially to the level that she did,” Hogg said. “I think now with advertisers standing with us, we can accomplish anything.”Ingraham was accused of being “racist” with her February commentary about politicized athletes, but in her own defense, the Fox host noted that she has used the “shut up and” phrase many times in many situations, even using the phrase in her 2003 best selling book, “Shut Up & Sing.”“In 2003, I wrote a New York Times bestseller called ‘Shut Up & Sing,’ in which I criticized celebrities like the Dixie Chicks & Barbra Streisand who were trashing then-President George W. Bush,” Ingraham said in response to claims she was a racist for attacking LeBron James. I have used a variation of that title for more than 15 years to respond to performers who sound off on politics.”Ingraham sparked Hogg’s retaliation with a March 24 tweet snickering at the teen for being rejected by several colleges he applied to attend.David Hogg Rejected By Four Colleges To Which He Applied and whines about it.

In reality, the Times is not asking the question. It mocks you into thinking the question is a legitimate one. The real title should be: “Muslim Grievances, Why We Are Right to Whine After Jihadis Attack.”The piece is not written by a legitimate, reasoned, and brilliant scholar of Islam like, say, Ibn Waraq, Bat Ye’or, or Robert Spencer. No, this absurd propaganda is by one of the Times’ resident shills for Islam, Atossa Araxia Abrahmian, coming in form of a review of Journey Into Europe: Islam, Immigration, and Identity, the latest installment in Islamic studies professor Akbar Ahmed’s series on Muslims around the world.The finger-pointing at the infidel for the violence and holy wars of devout Muslims is at its apex in this indictment of Western compassion and open borders. And Muslims, of course, are the real victims:The bulk of Ahmed’s research comes from a listening tour he embarked on with a team of researchers between 2013 and 2017. They interviewed imams, community leaders, activists and ordinary people across the continent about the challenges European Muslims face today. Their findings are predictably grim. Across the board, interviewees reported feeling marginalized, stereotyped and prevented from professional advancement because of their background. Despite their multitude of experiences, they ended up lumped into the crude categories that conflate terrorists, Muslims and refugees; Arabs, Persians and Africans; recent immigrants with no facility in the local language and second-generation doctoral students fluent at the highest level.“Many patterns of discrimination,” Ahmed notes, “are rooted in colonial legacies that vary by country[.]”Ah, yes colonial legacies – nothing about Islamic imperialism and annihilationism. Nothing about the centuries of jihadi wars, land appropriations, cultural annihilations, and enslavements. Robert Spencer’s much anticipated tome on Islamic history, The History of Jihad: From Muhammad to ISIS, details this very thing and should be part of every school curriculum in the country.This whole piece is an extraordinary lie, and the Left’s relentless promotion of the big lies have rendered us ill-prepared for what’s coming.In this “book review,” Abrahamian tells us that the author was invited to speak at a mosque in Athens.What he saw there took him aback. The facility was less a house of God than an underground parking lot “of a particularly sinister aspect[.]”“These men had nothing to lose, and I could imagine the most desperate among them prepared to lash out in an unpredictable and even murderous manner,” Ahmed writes in Journey Into Europe. “This, I felt, was Europe’s ticking time bomb.”Oh yes, because the mosque in Athens, Greece — a country whose suffering at the hands of Muslim invaders is incalculable and little spoken of (like the Armenians) — is not pretty, it only makes sense that the Muslims destroy Europe. Are we to believe that if the Greeks built shrines to their executioners, all would be well?So the jihad in Europe is the Greeks’ fault, but Christians in Muslim countries who can’t pray and whose houses of worship are systematically destroyed have no recourse, no voice, no New York Times article that speaks the truth of their oppression and destruction. On the contrary, in the view of the New York Times, the Christians are the problem.The complaining and the whining continues. Ahmed, in this book, says:Pakistanis in Britain are better integrated than, say, French citizens of Algerian and Moroccan descent. But even absent empire, many of the Muslims he speaks to find it hard, if not impossible, to fit in. “In Denmark they strangle you slowly, slowly,” one interviewee proclaims.Pakistanis in the UK are better integrated? Thousands of English girls are groomed by Muslim rape gangs which the police never pursued for fear of being perceived as “islamophobic.” Daily acts of jihad written off as some generic form of extremism. This passes for integration?Ahmed “hopes Europeans can form new, hybrid identities that broaden the criteria for who belongs.” Where have Muslim societies ever allowed a hybrid of identity? What he is saying is, he hopes that Europeans will go quietly into the cold Islamic night.Using Islamic historic lies, Abrahmian bolsters his argument:Europe happens to have a homegrown example of this philosophy in medieval Andalusia, when people of multiple faiths in parts of modern-day Portugal and Spain enjoyed convivencia, a state of relative pluralism, peace and prosperity under Muslim rule. “The answer to the violence and tensions between religions in Europe today and the sense of alienation and confusion in Muslim youth is to revive and strengthen the Andalusian model as an alternative to that of a monolithic tribal society,” Ahmed writes.Andalusia was hardly golden for the Christians and Jews living under Islamic rule:Islamic Spain was far from being a paradise. Cordoba was no “ornament of the world.” Maimonides had to flee the city because of the persecution of the Almohads, but even before the Alhomads the treatment of non-Muslims was dismal. When the Jewish viziers Samuel ibn Naghrela and his son Joseph were both murdered, and then the entire Jewish community of Grenada was massacred as well – yes, in Grenada, home of the “Alhambra” of which Washington Irving sung — it was not something without deep Islamic roots. (more here)Abrahmian closes with this pearl:The fundamental message of “Journey Into Europe” is that throughout history, Islamic and European civilizations have often been not just compatible, but complementary. It’s crucial to acknowledge their shared past to reject today’s resurgent tribalism. The stakes, as Ahmed puts it, are “Andalusia or dystopia.”Intellectually, his conclusion is hard to argue with. But since 9/11, popular perceptions of Islam in the West have been informed by emotion, not facts or reason.That’s true. And this New York Times article is more of that emotional, fact-free propaganda.Pamela Geller is the President of the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI), publisher of The Geller Report and author of the bestselling book, FATWA: Hunted in America, as well as The Post-American Presidency: The Obama Administration’s War on America, and Stop the Islamization of America: A Practical Guide to the Resistance.

A regional director of Germany’s constitutional police said of the faith in 2017 that “every jihadist terrorist we’ve seen in Europe in recent years came from the Salafist scene”.In addition to banning the radical interpretation of Islam, a majority of French surveyed also supported deporting terrorists, too. Le Figaro reports 83 per cent supported deporting foreigners on French soil who have so-called ‘S’ (security) case files on them held by the security services — the French term demonstrating that an individual is considered a potentially dangerous radical by the French state.Part and Parcel: France Deploys 100,000 Soldiers and Police Officers for the Holidays https://t.co/fmuHVUUjQm— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 24, 2017France admits to there being approximately 20,000 people on that list, meaning thousands of individuals could be deported from France should the will of the overwhelming majority of French citizens be translated into government policy.The terrorist who killed four in and around Carcassonne in March, Radouane Lakdim, was a high priority subject of that list and had been on it since 2014 — but still, French police were unable to prevent the attack. Deportations could relieve some pressure from the security services — a former French intelligence official whistleblower this week revealed the state did not have enough agents or resources to watch all of the suspects.The survey also found broad support for the extension of a state of emergency in France at 61 per cent, those agreeing even if to do so meant a curtailment of freedoms for citizens. "

The first part of the text is entitled “The Intercontinental Islamic State” and includes lessons on “The Expansion of the Islamic State in the Continent of Asia… Africa; and… Europe.”Image from a Palestinian Authority school textbook, via Impact-SEThe Impact-SE report explains: “Since the identity imparted by the [Palestinian Authority] curriculum is also imperial pan-Arab and Islamist, animosity toward Western imperialism and Europe in general is widespread across the new curriculum.”Another textbook, aimed at 10-year-olds, describes martyrdom and jihad as “the most important meanings of life”, advising that “drinking the cup of bitterness with glory is much sweeter than a pleasant long life accompanied by humiliation”.Joan Ryan, chairman of Labour Friends of Israel, told The Times: “It is absolutely appalling that UK taxpayers’ money is helping to support the teaching of a curriculum which incites violence and terrorism and spreads anti-semitism.“The government must immediately suspend all aid to the Palestinian Authority until it commits to wholesale and urgent revisions of the curriculum.”The Department for International Development said: “Our support is helping around 25,000 young Palestinians go to school each year.

b'Delingpole: Finally \xe2\x80\x98Climate Change\xe2\x80\x99 Gets Its Scopes Monkey Trial\xe2\x80\x93and the Bad Guys Are Gonna Lose',http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/31/delingpole-finally-climate-change-gets-its-scopes-monkey-trial-and-the-bad-guys-are-gonna-lose/,"But like it or not this is essentially what is being played out right now in a U.S. federal court in San Francisco.The climate alarmists have finally got their day in court against those pesky free-thinking intelligent people they call “climate deniers.”Big mistake. The overconfident alarmists appear to have bitten off more than they can chew. They imagined that they’d fool the world into thinking that this was a case about ordinary, wronged citizens – specifically the cities of San Francisco and neighboring Oakland – taking on the evil, sea-level-raising, planet-destroying might of Big Oil.In reality, as is becoming clearer by the day, it’s the “science” of climate change which is really on trial here. And given that the “science” of climate change is so shaky that it might as well be called “witchcraft” this is not a discussion that’s likely to end well for the shysters who are promoting it…BackgroundThe origins of this case lie in #Exxonknew. Its purpose is to attack the fossil fuel industry using much the same methods once employed against the tobacco industry. The plan was dreamed up in 2012 by a small group of climate activists meeting in La Jolla, California.The cities of San Francisco and Oakland are suing five Big Oil firms – Chevron, Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips, BP, and Royal Dutch Shell – alleging that they have conspired, Big-Tobacco-style, to conceal the harm of their products. Apparently, these oil majors ought to be compelled to pay billions of dollars in compensation for the damage they have done, inter alia by causing sea levels to rise.The JudgeAlready, the plaintiffs have run into a major problem. Judge William Alsup – who by rights really ought to have been one of their guys, given that he’s a Clinton appointment who lives in California – turns out to be the real deal. As this excellent overview by Tony Thomas in Quadrant notes, he has a reputation for not just taking anybody’s word for it:While presiding in Uber v. Waymo, for example, he asked for a tutorial on self-driving car technology. In Oracle v. Google, he taught himself some Java programming language, to help understand the case.The very last thing the plaintiffs needed was a judge who does his homework. They needed one who would take their junk science at face value.Already, Judge Alsup has pretty much dismissed the Exxonknew conspiracy theory. “From what I’ve seen, and feel free to send me other documentation, but all I’ve seen so far is that someone [from an oil major] went to the IPCC conference and took notes. That’s not a conspiracy,” he saidl.This does not augur well for the plaintiffs.Big OilThe oil majors have been about as helpful as a chocolate fireguard in this case. You’d think that with all those billions, they’d have a little to set aside to make a decent fight in defense of their own industry. But in fact, for reasons ranging from cowardice to convenience to cynicism, most of them are heavily invested in the alarmist cause. Exxon’s Rex Tillerson wanted the U.S. to stay in the Paris Climate Accord; Shell’s CEO Ben Van Beurden is a veritable Uriah Heep when it comes to grovelling about the evils of his industry; BP once tried to rebrand itself “Beyond Petroleum” lest anyone confuse it with a company whose business model depended on extracting sticky black stuff from the ground.When the judge asked the various parties to give him a tutorial on climate change, only Chevron bothered to do so. Instead, most of the best scientific arguments have been made for them by skeptics offering amicus curiae – ‘friends of the court’ – briefs. Despite what you hear claimed by climate alarmists, skeptics receive little if any financial support from the oil industry because the oil industry just doesn’t want the flak – and it knows that skeptics are so committed to their cause they’re prepared to say this stuff for free, so why bother?The SkepticsOne amicus curiae team, supported by the Heartland Institute, comprises Christopher Monckton, Willie Soon, David Legates and William Briggs. Here is a transcript of their brief. And here – courtesy of Quadrant – is a short summary:There is no “consensus” among scientists that recent global warming was chiefly anthropogenic, still less that unmitigated anthropogenic warming has been or will be dangerous or catastrophic …Even if it be assumed [for the sake of argument] that all of the 0.8 degC global warming since anthropogenic influence first became potentially significant in 1950 was attributable to us, in the present century little more than 1.2 degC of global warming is to be expected, not the 3.3 degC that the  IPCC had predicted.The other team comprises William Happer, Steven Koonin and Richard Lindzen. Here is a summary of their argument:The AlarmistsThese people have two major problems: a) they’re not intellectually in the same league as the skeptics and b) the science just doesn’t support them.The Warmist team’s leading academic is Professor Myles Allen of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University. This sounds impressive. But he didn’t do himself many favors when at one point, he told the court “Now oxygen is almost 29 percent of the atmosphere.” OK, so perhaps he was just having a Condor moment (the correct figure is 21 percent). His bigger difficulty is that his argument for the existence of catastrophic anthropogenic global warming theory is riddled with omissions and inaccuracies which are cruelly exposed here.Allen’s presentation, for example, made much of Svante Arrhenius, the Swedish chemist who posited that increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations would cause “global warming” (though Arrhenius considered this to be a good thing, not a bad thing). But our understanding of climate change has moved on since then, not least in the recognition that water vapor is a far more significant greenhouse gas than CO2.As his anonymous demolisher notes on the blog:Dr. Myles Allen points out that CO2 is potent relative to the non-GHGs of O2 and N2, but fails to address H2O. That is like claiming an aspirin cured the pain AFTER being given a huge dose of morphine, and never mentioning the morphine.There is much more in this scathing vein, such as this dismissal of Allen’s claim to the court that carbon dioxide is rising to levels not seen for 20 million years:Cherry picking at its best. CO2 has been as high as 7,000 ppm and NEVER caused catastrophic warming or ocean acidification. Life has thrived through all levels of atmospheric CO2. Coral Reefs formed during periods where there was much higher CO2. The globe fell into an ice age when CO2 was 4,000 ppm, 10x what it is today. BTW, plants die when CO2 falls below 180 ppm. We are near the lowest level in geological history for CO2, and we are dangerously close to the level where plants starve to death. Warming is infinitely preferable to an ice age. Funny how Dr. Myles Allen forgot to include the longer-term CO2 graphic. BTW, that CO2 graphic follows standard of living far better than temperatures.The bottom line is, if you’re going to duke it out on the science, you’d better make damn sure that your science is better than your opponent’s science. In the Alarmists’ case this just isn’t an option.Never Get Into A Fight You Can’t WinUp till now the Alarmists have understood this. It’s why they roll the way they do, preferring to use the Appeal to Authority (and underhand bullying and smearing attacks) rather than engage skeptics in public debate. Whenever they’ve done the latter, they’ve tended to lose – as Tony Thomas notes at Quadrant.“Do not debate!” has been warmist policy  ever since their talent was trounced by the sceptic team in a two-hour New York public debate at Radio City Hall in 2007.[7]The audience initially polled 57.3% to 29.9% for a “Global Warming Crisis”, but after the debate that flipped 46.2% to 42.2% in favour of the sceptics.US warmist “experts” subsequently refused even to share platforms with sceptic rivals if informed critics of their shtick are given equal standing. In March, 2013, Gavin Schmidt, director of the NASA/GISS climate group, fled the TV interview room (from 6.20 mins) when he learned Roy Spencer, an expert on earth temperature readings from satellite, was arriving and would subject him to questions. A year later Dan Weiss, the director of climate strategy at the liberal Center for American Progress, did an equivalent runner rather than face sceptic Marc Morano in debate, as did Hollywood icon and “Titanic” director James Cameron in 2010.In a recent exception, warmist Jon Christensen (UCal LA) and sceptic Willie Soon (Harvard) went head to head at a Comedy Club in Los Angeles in January. The result was not scored but the audience jeered whenever Christensen denied California’s soaring power prices were hurting low-income families.This attempt by alarmists to take on five oil majors smacks of hubris. Or desperation. Or suicidal complacency. Or perhaps a mix of all three. Because the alarmist position happens also to be the longstanding establishment position, it’s possible that they have been lulled into forgetting just how weak their case actually is.The Exxonknew trial belongs to another era: the one before Donald Trump came along and drove a coach and horses through the so-called climate “consensus.”This cannot end well for the Alarmists who brought this dishonest, vexatious, and expensive case.What did they think they were playing at?"

He was asked if there was any news story that he regretted doing.Rivera replied:I regret in 2002 backing down from backing the Palestinians in their conflict with Israel. The Second Intifada. Because I saw with my own eyes how. And I know how this is going to resonate very poorly with the people watching right now. But still, I have to tell you how I feel. I saw at firsthand how those people were. And now you said 14, 15 people killed in Gaza. Palestinians killed by the IDF forces. I saw what an awful life they live under constant occupation and oppression.And people keep saying, “Oh, they are terrorists. Or they are this or they are that.” They are an occupied people and I regret chickening out after 2002 and not staying on that story and adding my voice as a Jew, adding my voice to those counseling a two-state solution. It is so easy to put them out of sight, out of mind. And let them rot. And be killed. And keep this thing festering. And I think a lot of our current problems stem from – that’s almost our original sin. Palestine and Israel. I want a two-state solution. I want President Trump to re-energize the peace process.Watch Rivera’s remarks below (they begin at the 27 minute mark):﻿The Second Palestinian Intifada, or Palestinian “uprising” against Israel, was a campaign of terrorism in which the Palestinians carried out scores of suicide bombings and shooting attacks targeting Israelis. Over 1,100 Israelis were murdered in the onslaught.Rivera said he regrets not backing the Second Palestinian Intifada, claiming Palestinians are living under “occupation.” He complained that he should have done more to push the so-called two-state solution, which calls for a Palestinian state.Rivera failed to note the timeline of the Second Intifada, which started in 2000. It was launched after PLO Leader Yasser Arafat rejected U.S.-brokered talks at Camp David in which the Palestinians were offered a state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and eastern Jerusalem, with control over mosques on the Temple Mount. When Arafat rejected the far-reaching offer, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak attempted to continue the talks in Taba, Egypt, but Arafat turned down the continued statehood offers.The Second Intifada was not launched because Israel rejected the two-state solution. It was started after Arafat walked away from multiple statehood offers made during the course of numerous peace talks.In 2010, Hamas Co-founder Mahmoud al-Zahar explained that Arafat was behind the launching of the Intifada following the failure of the peace talks. “President Arafat instructed Hamas to carry out a number of military operations in the heart of the Jewish state after he felt that his negotiations with the Israeli government then had failed,” Zahar stated.Arafat’s widow, Suha, told Dubai TV in 2013 that Arafat instructed her to stay away from the West Bank because he was going to launch an intifada. This after Arafat rejected the Palestinian statehood offers.Suha stated:Yasser Arafat had made a decision to launch the Intifada. Immediately after the failure of the Camp David [negotiations], I met him in Paris upon his return, in July 2001 [sic]. Camp David has failed, and he said to me: “You should remain in Paris.” I asked him why, and he said: “Because I am going to start an Intifada…”Rivera, meanwhile, referenced “14, 15 people killed in Gaza. Palestinians killed by the IDF forces.”Of the 16 Palestinians reportedly killed during the recent violent riots at the Gaza-Israel border, the IDF on Saturday announced that ten were members of Palestinian terrorist groups, publishing their names and jihadist positions.Hamas itself provided evidence that it is cynically utilizing the cover of civilian demonstrators to attack Israel, drawing Israeli fire toward the crowds. On Saturday, Hamas released photographs of five members of its so-called military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades jihad unit, announcing they were among the 16 Gazans reportedly killed on Friday.Hamas stated that the five jihadists were killed while taking part “in popular events side-by-side with their people.” In other words, the terrorists were killed most likely attempting to carry out attacks while surrounded by civilian protesters.Hamas operatives camouflage themselves among civilians, turning a protest from peaceful to an area of terror pic.twitter.com/t37BRBQK9U— IDF (@IDFSpokesperson) March 31, 2018The IDF said the Hamas members disguised themselves among the civilian protesters.According to the IDF, rioters on Friday threw firebombs and hurled rocks at soldiers, attempted to breach the Israeli border, attempted to damage the border fence, and opened fire on Israeli troops.The IDF released scores of pictures capturing the violence, including Palestinians in the midst of attacking soldiers.

b'New York Restaurant Workers Tell Hollywood A-Listers \xe2\x80\x98We Did Not Ask for Your Help\xe2\x80\x99 on Pay Raise',http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2018/04/01/new-york-restaurant-workers-tell-hollywood-listers-not-ask-help-pay-raise/,"The large group of A-listers, including Sarah Jessica Parker, Reese Witherspoon, Natalie Portman and more, signed onto a letter sent to New York’s Democrat Governor Andrew Cuomo demanding that he sign a bill to raise the minimum wage for tipped restaurant workers, the New York Post reported.The current law forces businesses to pay tipped workers $8.65 per hour. But the Hollywood celebrities want that wage to be raised to the same level as the normal minimum wage, which is set to reach $15 by the year 2020.However, a campaign started by Maggie Raczynski, an Outback Steakhouse bartender in Clifton Park, New York, is telling the Hollywooders that their intercession is not wanted.“You’ve been misled,” Raczynski said in her letter endorsed by 500 other New York restaurant workers.“To the celebrity women who recently criticized the full-service restaurant industry, from thousands of women who work in it, thank you for your concern. But we don’t need your help, and we’re not asking to be saved. You’ve been misled that we earn less than minimum wage, and that we are somehow helpless victims of sexual harassment,” the workers say in their open letter, according to the Post Star.“Bad behavior happens in every industry—Hollywood celebrities should know better than most that sexual harassment happens everywhere,” Raczynski’s letter continues. “The people who are pushing for this change in the restaurant industry are exploiting the isolated stories of people that have suffered injustices, and making it out to be the industry’s or the tipping system’s fault. That is just not true.”“We respect your profession, and now it’s time for you to respect ours,” the missive concludes.Raczynski says that she and her fellow workers think that if the celebrities are successful in pushing a higher wage, the higher costs will hurt their jobs. “The cost of food is going to go up, and the number of servers is going to go down,” she said.The Outback employee and activist also said that if menu prices rise, customers will leave less in tips and that also hurts employees who earn tips.“How am I supposed to survive on $10.40 an hour?” Raczynski said, according to the Adirondack Daily Enterprise. “If the end goal of this is to collect more tax money from people—how much are you going to collect from unemployed people who lose their businesses?”JoeyLynn Ramsier, a waitress in Watertown, New York, agreed that the forced wage hike would hurt the restaurant industry in general and those whom the celebrities claim they want to help in particular.“I work for myself, but I [waitress] on the side to make extra money because I’m a single mom with two kids,” Ramsier, said. She added that if the wage goes up, her income will likely go down and then it would be a waste of time to even work. “I won’t do it. It’s not worth the money,” she said.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston."
