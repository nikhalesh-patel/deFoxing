"b'Kentucky, Oklahoma teachers walk out of classrooms to demand higher pay, more funding'",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/04/02/kentucky-oklahoma-teachers-walk-out-classrooms-to-demand-higher-pay-more-funding.html,"Kentucky teachers are demonstrating about the pension reform bill that was just passed. Mike Tobin reports.Thousands of educators in Kentucky and Oklahoma took to the streets of their respective state capitals Monday to demand higher pay and more funding for public education.Many Oklahoma schools, including the three largest districts of Oklahoma City, Tulsa and Edmond, were closed Monday, with districts announcing plans to keep campuses shut into Tuesday to accommodate more planned demonstrations.Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin signed legislation last week granting teachers pay raises of about $6,100, or 15 to 18 percent -- the first such hike in 10 years. But some educators say that isn't good enough. The state's largest teachers union has demanded a $10,000 pay raise for educators over three years, $5,000 for support personnel and a $75 million increase in funding this year.""If I didn't have a second job, I'd be on food stamps,"" said Rae Lovelace, a single mom and a third-grade teacher at Leedey Public Schools in northwest Oklahoma who works 30 to 40 hours a week at a second job teaching online courses for a charter school.Some schools in Oklahoma are offering free meals to students aged 18 or younger while various churches, faith organizations and charitable agencies are providing free day-care services. Spring break was last week in many Oklahoma districts.Oklahoma ranks 47th among states and the District of Columbia in public school revenue per student, nearly $3,000 below the national average, while its average teacher salary of $45,276 ranked 49th before the latest raises, according to the most recent statistics from the National Education Association.In Frankfort, Ky., teachers and other school employees gathered outside the Kentucky Education Association a couple of blocks from the Capitol, chanting ""Stop the war on public education"" and held signs that say ""We've Had Enough.""Other teachers, chanting ""We won't back down,"" crammed into the Capitol, filling the Rotunda and hallways near the House and Senate chambers. Schools across the state were closed, due either to spring break or to allow teachers and other school employees to attend the rally.Amid a chorus of chants from teachers rallying in the Capitol, Kentucky lawmakers considered a new state budget that includes higher spending for public education.Budget negotiators unveiled a spending plan Monday that includes increased spending for the main funding formula for K-12 schools and restored money for school buses that the state's Republican governor had proposed eliminating.The additional education spending would be paid for by a 6 percent sales tax on a host of services that had previously been tax-free.The spending and taxing proposals cleared the Senate on Monday and went to the House, which was expected to vote on the measures later Monday.Language arts teacher Lesley Buckner was reluctant to give lawmakers much credit.""We're sending a message,"" she said. ""If we continue to stay united, they cannot turn away from us, they cannot turn their backs on us.""The rally happened after hundreds of teachers called in sick Friday to protest last-minute changes to their pension system. Teachers have rallied several times during Kentucky's legislative session to protest the pension bill, but Monday was by far their biggest event.Republican lawmakers in Kentucky passed a pension overhaul Thursday that preserves benefits for most workers but cuts them for new teachers. The move was done in response to chronic underfunding of the state's teacher retirement system and in defiance of a powerful teachers union that vowed political retribution. Opponents objected that the pension changes were inserted into an unrelated bill without a chance for public input, and worry that the changes will discourage young people from joining the profession.Republican Gov. Matt Bevin has not yet signed the bill, but last week tweeted his support, saying public workers owe ""a deep debt of gratitude"" to lawmakers who voted to pass it.During Monday's rally, some teachers, angry at lawmakers who supported the bill, chanted ""Vote them out.""Melissa Wash, a first-grade teacher from Gallatin County who has been teaching for 19 years, said she voted for Bevin, but now plans to become a Democrat. To the lawmakers who voted for the pension overhaul, she said: ""You better not count on another year in office.""The demonstrations were inspired by West Virginia, where teachers walked out for nine days earlier this year and won a 5 percent increase in pay. Teachers in Arizona are now considering a strike over their demands for a 20 percent salary increase.""Their success has shown us that collective activity can work,"" Kentucky teacher Corey Sayre said of the West Virginia walkout.The Associated Press contributed to this report."

"b""Man charged in serial killings isn't facing death penalty""",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/04/02/man-charged-in-serial-killings-isnt-facing-death-penalty.html,"BATON ROUGE, La. –  Louisiana prosecutors aren't seeking the death penalty against a suspect charged with killing three men and wounding a fourth in a string of shootings last year.District Attorney Samuel D'Aquilla told The Associated Press on Monday that he informed Ryan Sharpe's defense attorney of his decision not to seek the death penalty against the 36-year-old man over a deadly shooting in East Feliciana Parish. D'Aquilla added that he still reserves the right to seek the death penalty if ""something changes for us dramatically"" as the case proceeds.Sharpe is charged with first-degree murder in the Oct. 9 shooting of Boy Scouts employee Brad DeFranceschi, who was gunned down while trimming weeds in front of his house. DeFranceschi lived on Boy Scouts camp property in Clinton, a town of 1,600 people about 30 miles (50 kilometers) northeast of Baton Rouge.The charges that he faces in the other three shootings aren't punishable by a death sentence.Sharpe is charged with second-degree murder in the July 8 shooting of 62-year-old Tommy Bass, who was killed in the carport of his home. He is charged with attempted first-degree murder in the Sept. 12 shooting of 47-year-old Buck Hornsby, who was wounded while exercising on his property. And he is charged with second-degree murder in the Sept. 19 killing of 66-year-old Carroll Breeden, who was shot to death while doing yard work in front of his home in East Baton Rouge Parish.D'Aquilla said he based his decision on several factors, including the ""very time-consuming"" nature of capital murder cases. He said he expects Sharpe's attorneys to challenge his ""mental capacity"" to stand trial.""We don't want to get into a lengthy battle with that,"" D'Aquilla said.Tommy Damico, one of Sharpe's attorneys, said a defense argument that Sharpe is mentally unfit for trial ""may be on the table.""""Without getting into all of the evidence, this is a very unusual type of situation,"" Damico said.A 2009 law amended Louisiana's first-degree-murder statute to make it easier for prosecutors to seek the death penalty against people accused of serial killings. But the change in the law ""hasn't really been tested"" yet in either the Louisiana Supreme Court or U.S. Supreme Court, D'Aquilla said, citing that as another factor in his decision.The four shootings happened in a rural area north of Baton Rouge and left residents on edge for weeks. The victims were middle-age or older white men who were shot at their homes or on their property. Sharpe, who owned a plumbing company, also is white.A law enforcement official told the AP last year that Sharpe wasn't a suspect in the shootings until he called East Feliciana Parish Sheriff Jeff Travis' office on Oct. 11 and identified himself as the killer. The official spoke only on condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing.Travis has said Sharpe confessed when investigators questioned him after his arrest. Travis also has said detectives found ""significant physical evidence"" linking Sharpe to the shootings.Sharpe's trial in East Feliciana Parish is tentatively set to start on Aug. 27, but Damico said he expects it to be postponed."

b'Vegas hospital advisory after mass  shooting draws scrutiny',http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/04/02/vegas-hospital-advisory-after-mass-shooting-draws-scrutiny.html,"LAS VEGAS –  A review of medical responses after the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history in Las Vegas found confusion led to a fire department broadcast that the only top-tier regional trauma center was too full to accept any more victims of the attack, a newspaper reported Monday.The problem began when University Medical Center called an ""internal disaster"" alert following the Oct. 1 shooting at an open-air concert venue on the Las Vegas Strip, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported .The alert was intended for UMC so hospital employees would know all hands were needed, but officials said it confused emergency responders who issued a radio advisory that the emergency room was out of beds.In January, the newspaper said it took at least 15 minutes to correct the message, and at least two injured people were diverted from the UMC Level 1 trauma center to other facilities.Sunrise Hospital & Medical Center, which has a Level 2 trauma facility and is the hospital closest to the Strip, handled 212 patients, according to official reports. UMC took 104.UMC and Clark County emergency management officials have not fully explained why UMC called the alert and declined to comment for the newspaper report.The Southern Nevada Health District facility advisory board is revisiting the use of such alerts.Henderson Fire Deputy Chief Scott Vivier said alerts usually mean beds and waiting rooms are full, extra employees have been called, elective surgeries are postponed and transfers from other hospitals are stopped.John Hammond, health district emergency medical services and trauma systems manager, told board members in January that he planned to institute a time limit of 90 minutes on the alerts to help hospital staff members who forget to switch it off.The term ""internal disaster"" alert was coined by the Southern Nevada Health District in 2004 to curb emergency room diversions that forced ambulance drivers to sometimes hop from one facility to another, said Rory Chetelat, former county health district emergency medical services manager.In the past 14 years, the use of such alerts has become common at some Las Vegas-area hospitals, including University Medical Center, the only public hospital in the region.In 2017, UMC issued the alerts 4.3 times a week on average, lasting nearly 630 hours for the year.Among 12 other area facilities, only Dignity Health-St. Rose Dominican Hospital's Siena Campus in suburban Henderson used the alert more last year.University Medical Center chief executive Mason VanHouweling told the Review-Journal that the hospital is trying to address overcrowding by adding 18 beds to its emergency room.___Information from: Las Vegas Review-Journal, http://www.lvrj.com___Information from: Las Vegas Review-Journal, http://www.lvrj.com"
b'An atypical terror case comes to close with 20-year sentence',http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/04/02/atypical-terror-case-comes-to-close-with-20-year-sentence.html,"BALTIMORE –  It was July 2015 when the FBI, scrambling to contain a surge in Islamic State propaganda, first visited an Egyptian-American newspaper deliveryman in Maryland.Agents needed to ask Mohamed Elshinawy why his phone number had surfaced in an investigation involving ISIS extremists, and how he came to receive a $1,000 Western Union transaction from Egypt.During hours of questioning, Elshinawy first suggested the money was from his mother. Next he said it was for an iPhone purchase for a friend. After being reminded it was a crime to lie to federal agents, he proceeded to tell a different story — that he had indeed received money from ISIS but was actually scamming the group instead of planning an attack.It was a pivotal moment in a months-long FBI investigation that ended Friday with Elshinawy being sentenced to 20-years imprisonment on terrorism-related charges.The case had a chilling twist: Officials say that among the roughly 150 ISIS-linked cases U.S. authorities have brought since 2014, this is the only prosecution they're aware of in which money was transmitted from ISIS operatives abroad to someone in the U.S. That inverts the more common model in which money from America is sent to fighters in Syria.The investigation stretched from a modest townhome northeast of Baltimore across multiple continents, unveiled a shadowy network of illicit payments and shell companies and revealed a direct link to an ISIS hacker who was killed in a drone strike in Syria just before Elshinawy's arrest.Law enforcement officials involved in the case spoke to The Associated Press about it in detail, recounting a high-intensity investigation that required round-the-clock surveillance, the scouring of bank records and constant concern that money sent to Elshinawy would fund an attack.Brian Nadeau, a Baltimore FBI assistant special agent in charge, said the case raised a lot of red flags.""Why is the money coming this way? Who is this person? What level are they at?"" he said. The FBI, he said, ""can't let someone who's receiving ISIS money be out running around. Who knows if we're in the middle of it, the beginning of it, the end, and what their plan is?""Elshinawy's lawyers didn't return messages seeking comment, but they have argued that his social media communications — such as his claim that he was an ISIS ""soldier"" and was committed to ""violent jihad"" — were First Amendment-protected and merely aspirational.Elshinawy had admitted conspiring with ISIS under a plea agreement, but he defended himself at his sentencing hearing, saying in a statement ""I am not a terrorist,"" according to the Baltimore Sun.It's not clear how close Elshinawy came to an attack, though FBI officials said they believed the threat of violence was real. Elshinawy's lawyers said in a sentencing memorandum that he was provided limited or no specific direction, but in statements to the FBI, he said he was given multiple options for violence and images of individuals who were potential targets, court papers say.ISIS generally doesn't need to fund attacks in the U.S. given the inexpensive nature of the violence it advocates and its reliance on social media to motivate followers. But officials in this case believe jihadists exploited a personal connection: a childhood friend of Elshinawy's from Egypt who fled to Syria, joined ISIS, communicated with him on social media and encouraged him to pledge allegiance to the group.His skill in covering his electronic tracks — he used encrypted communications applications and proxies — likely made Elshinawy a natural conduit, officials said.Given that bond, said one official speaking on condition of anonymity, ""He doesn't even need to be vetted, he was already vetted.""All told, officials say, he received nearly $9,000 in money transfers, including through PayPal accounts, and used the funds for phones, a laptop and a private VPN network for communication with militants overseas. The funds, disguised as money for printers, were routed throughout the globe in a web of wire transfers. Much of it came from a United Kingdom-based IT company run by Siful Sujan, an ISIS computer hacker killed in December 2015 airstrikes in Syria.""I think they thought they were going to just have a run-of-the-mill ISIS case, and when they pulled back the onion, they realized that (Elshinawy) was a key node,"" said Seamus Hughes, deputy director of George Washington University's Program on Extremism, who has written about the case.The FBI's first interview with Elshinawy came amid heightened alertness of ISIS-inspired extremism, weeks after an attempted rampage at a Prophet Mohammed cartoon contest in Texas and one day after shootings at military facilities in Tennessee.Officials say he deflected questions about the money transfer with answers they knew were untruthful. At one point, officials said, he pulled out an iPhone to display a Facebook conversation in Arabic, but the English translation he provided was clearly improvised, the FBI said.After several hours, and an admonishment to come clean, he admitted receiving the money from ISIS but said he was scamming the group because he never intended to commit violence, officials said. He said his cleverness should be rewarded and that he should be hired by the FBI to help untangle the ISIS money network, according to court papers.The interviews continued over two weeks and the results from search warrants and subpoenas yielded insights that alarmed officials further.Elshinawy had pledged allegiance to ISIS in February 2015 and, in conversations with his friend, pronounced himself ready for jihad and asked for advice in bomb-making, court papers say.""I do not have dreams or aspirations in this world except the Jihad...I want just to go to Jihad and be with the Islamic State,"" he wrote, according to court papers.He responded to the unrest in Baltimore that followed the April 2015 death of Freddie Gray by praising violence against police. And, the FBI says, he attempted to recruit a brother living in Saudi Arabia to join ISIS.Elshinawy has been in custody since his December 2015 arrest. Agents searching his home found articles about ISIS attacks, and his laptop held images of the severed head of an American in captivity and government buildings in Baltimore that officials believe were potential targets.""If this turned out to be successful,"" said Hughes, ""it would be a whole different way of looking at ISIS external operations in the U.S."""
