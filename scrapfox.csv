He was then charged in California on a series of counts, including pimping minors. Ferrer and other Backpage executives haven’t been convicted of criminal wrongdoing.PROSTITUTION STILL THRIVES ON BACKPAGE DESPITE SITE SHUTDOWN OF 'ADULT' SECTIONThe site – which is already the focus of multiple criminal investigations – has prompted lawmakers to reconsider legislation that limits the immunity of websites for the actions taken by their users.Members of Congress have also investigated the site for its alleged role in sex trafficking.“This is great news for survivors, advocates, and law enforcement,” Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., who has investigated the site alongside Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, told the Journal.Cindy McCain, the wife of Arizona Sen. John McCain, and an activist against human trafficking, told AZ Central that she heard that in addition to raiding Lacey’s home, every office of the site around the world was raided.“They’ve confiscated everything and shut the website down,” McCain said, adding that Friday was a “good day.”Backpage.com lets users create posts to sell items, seek a roommate, participate in forums, list upcoming events or post job openings. But the site also has listings for adult escorts and other sexual services, and authorities say advertising related to those services has been extremely lucrative.According to the notice on the site, authorities will release additional information on the seizure later Friday night.The Associated Press contributed to this report."

"b'Rain shuts Yosemite, threatens problems at tallest US dam'",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/04/06/california-storm-may-test-spillway-at-nations-tallest-dam.html,"SAN FRANCISCO –  A fierce Northern California storm Friday shut down Yosemite National Park, threatened mudslides in wildfire-ravaged wine country and could present the first test of a partially repaired offshoot of the nation's tallest dam that nearly collapsed last year.Recent heavy rainfall has led to problems for a state recovering from devastating wildfires, forcing people to flee their homes repeatedly for fear of debris flows tearing down hillsides stripped bare by flames. But the downpours also have provided relief as parts of California plunged back into drought less than a year after a historic dry stretch.Rain was falling throughout much of Northern California on Friday, leading Yosemite National Park to ban all visitors as it expects flooding in its tourist-heavy valley. Visitors can no longer enter Yosemite Valley, and those already there will be asked to leave by 5 p.m.The opener of the San Francisco Giants-Los Angeles Dodgers weekend series was rained out, the first at the Giants ballpark in 12 years.A couple of hundred miles northwest in wine country scorched during October wildfires, the National Weather Service predicted 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 centimeters) of rainfall through Sunday.The city of Santa Rosa, one of the hardest-hit burn areas, brought in extra firefighters and emergency personnel, fire department spokesman Paul Lowenthal said.It's not the amount of rainfall worrying city officials but the rate at which it falls, he said. Workers have been monitoring hundreds of storm drains, especially those protecting neighborhoods destroyed by fire.""When we start talking about half an inch of rain or more an hour, that's where we're more susceptible to mudslides and debris flow in and around our burn zones,"" Lowenthal said.The weather service issued several flood warnings throughout Northern California ahead of the expected ""atmospheric river,"" a long plume of subtropical moisture stretching to areas near Lake Tahoe.Some places in the Santa Cruz Mountains south of San Francisco could see up to 8 inches (20 centimeters) of rain over a three-day period, leading forecasters to warn of possible flooding, mudslides and rockslides.To the north, state officials warned this week that they may have to use the partially rebuilt spillway at Oroville Dam for the first time since repairs began on the badly damaged structure last summer.Behind the dam, Lake Oroville has been filling up all winter, and more water was coming in than flowing out Friday. The water level was last at 793 feet (242 meters) and dropping. If it reaches about 830 feet (253 meters), water managers say they will open the gates to the spillway.In February 2017, a massive crater opened up in the 3,000-foot (914-meter) concrete chute that releases water from Lake Oroville, California's second-largest reservoir.Crews shut down the spillway for inspections just as a major storm dumped a torrent of rain. The lake quickly filled, and water began flowing over an emergency spillway that had never been used.The water eroded the barren hillside beneath the spillway, leading to fears it would collapse and release a wall of water that could swamp communities downstream. Authorities ordered nearly 200,000 people to flee, but the crisis was averted.California officials say they hope to avoid using the main spillway but are confident it can safely function.News that the spillway may be needed has concerned some people in the city of Oroville, said Genoa Widener, a vocal critic of the water agency.While some of her friends have decided to leave for the weekend to be safe, Widener said she's not concerned the storm will pose a threat. Still, she's frustrated there's even a question about it.""They have the lake rise so much in the last month to try to have some kind of water stored going into the summer,"" she said. ""So they've kind of put us in this position again.""Leroy Mudrick said he's not worried because the water level is much lower than it was before last year's storm.""The lake is still way down,"" Mudrick said."
b'White House praises McMaster on his last day',http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/04/06/white-house-praises-mcmaster-on-his-last-day.html,"WASHINGTON –  As hundreds of people stood outside the White House and cheered, outgoing national security adviser H.R. McMaster strode out of the West Wing on Friday for the final time.He shook hands with staff and waved to clapping onlookers, his warm exit a stark contrast to the unceremonious departure of so many prior senior Trump aides. McMaster left after meeting for the final time with his successor, neo-conservative television commentator John Bolton, and then received a traditional ""clap out"" by staffers arrayed on West Executive Avenue.Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said McMaster and his family were met by President Donald Trump, who thanked him for his yearlong service in the post. Sanders also praised McMaster during the daily White House briefing, saying it had been a ""real privilege"" to work with and travel the world with the outgoing aide.In a statement, McMaster praised the National Security Council's strategic roles in addressing a number of international hot spots, including North Korea, China, Iran, Russia and Afghanistan. He thanked Trump for the opportunity to serve and offered his best wishes to Bolton.A three-star general, McMaster is set to retire from the Army later this year. Bolton will be Trump's third national security adviser.Trump never formed a close personal bond with McMaster and the two men frequently clashed on policy. After weeks of rumors, his departure was announced last month soon after someone at the White House leaked that Trump was urged in briefing documents not to congratulate Russian President Vladimir Putin about his recent re-election win. Trump did it anyway.The White House said McMaster's exit had been under discussion for some time and stressed it was not due to any one incident. The national security adviser, who took over last year after Michael Flynn was fired for lying about his contacts with Russian officials, had previously withstood an assault from figures in the conservative media who accused him of not being sufficiently supportive of Israel.A number of Trump senior aides did not receive a similarly warm exit.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was fired last month via tweet soon after returning from a trip to Africa. Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin was ousted last week amid ethics violations and not permitted to bid his staff farewell. But former communications director Hope Hicks, Trump's closest and longest-serving aide, received a kiss on the cheek from the president when she left the West Wing for the final time last week.Bolton, probably the most divisive foreign policy expert ever to serve as U.N. ambassador, has been a hawkish voice in Republican foreign policy circles for decades.___Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire"

b'NJ murder case dropped after 2 men spent 24 years in prison',http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/04/06/nj-murder-case-dropped-after-2-men-spent-24-years-in-prison.html,"NEW YORK –  Prosecutors dropped a case Friday against two men who spent 24 years behind bars in the bloody killing of a New Jersey video store clerk before DNA tests linked a key piece of evidence to another man.Eric Kelley and Ralph Lee had been released on bail after their convictions were overturned last year. But until Friday, they were facing a potential retrial in the 1993 death of Tito Merino in Paterson.With the case dismissed, ""I'm finally free,"" Lee said by phone.""I was looking forward to it one day, but I didn't think it was going to be today.""Kelley said he felt at once overwhelmed, exhausted and happy, said his lawyer, Vanessa Potkin.Passaic County prosecutors' decision to dismiss the case came a month after an appeals court turned down their bid to overturn a ruling that granted the men new trials. The appeals court didn't declare them innocent but said they'd be allowed to present evidence against the other man, adding that the DNA findings ""seriously undermined"" the soundness of the guilty verdicts.Prosecutor Camelia Valdes' office noted the appellate ruling, the years in prison that Lee and Kelley served and the difficulties of getting witnesses back on the stand in a quarter-century-old case.""Considering the totality of the circumstances, to re-try these matters 25 years later would not be in the interests of justice,"" Valdes' office said in a statement.Potkin, who works for the Innocence Project, said she hoped that the end of the case against Kelley would spur New Jersey officials to re-examine their approach to wrongful conviction claims.""The resistance we encountered was unacceptable,"" she said. ""You couldn't have had stronger indications of innocence here.""Merino, 22, was beaten and stabbed in a midday holdup at his uncle's video shop. Paterson's then-mayor said the killing made him sick to his stomach. Merino was a community college student who had emigrated from Peru with aspirations of becoming a doctor.Lee, now 55, and Kelley, 53, confessed but soon recanted. With no physical evidence against them, their prosecutions hinged on their confessions and testimony from witnesses who'd been in the video store around the time of the killing.In 2014, DNA tests showed that a baseball cap left near Merino's body was laden with DNA from a man convicted of a 1989 knifepoint holdup at a different Paterson shop. He'd been released from prison three months before the video store robbery.There was no DNA from Kelley or Lee.Prosecutors have said the new DNA match didn't prove Lee or Kelley innocent or outweigh the ""powerful evidence"" of confessions and witness accounts. Potkin and Lee's lawyer, Paul Casteleiro of Centurion Ministries, argued prosecutors were trying to paper over a bungled case.The man whose DNA was on the hat hasn't been charged in the video store killing. Prosecutors declined to comment Friday on whether they planned to reinvestigate or pursue him.Merino's uncle, Miguel Victoria, didn't immediately return a call Friday. He said last year that the new evidence had left Merino's relatives unsure what to think, but they hoped authorities would get to the bottom of it.Kelley has been working at a pancake restaurant that hired him after hearing of his case, Potkin said. Lee said he's been grappling with medical problems that began in prison.Still, dad Ralph Lee Sr. said, ""This is the first the first day I've seen him smiling."""

Further details were not immediately available.Trump told reporters Thursday that he wants to send between 2,000 and 4,000 National Guard members to the border to help fight illegal immigration and drug trafficking.That would be lower than the roughly 6,000 National Guard members that former President George W. Bush sent in 2006 during another border security operation, though more than the 1,200 Guard members President Barack Obama sent in 2010.While several governors, including Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, have welcomed Trump's call for troops on the border, none have announced specific plans. A spokeswoman for Abbott did not immediately return messages Friday.Department of Homeland Security officials have said Guard members could support Border Patrol agents and other law enforcement agencies. DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said this week that guard members could ""help look at the technology, the surveillance,"" and that the department might ask for fleet mechanics.From 2006 to 2008, the Guard fixed vehicles, maintained roads, repaired fences and performed ground surveillance. Its second mission in 2010 and 2011 involved more aerial surveillance and intelligence work.Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, now Trump's energy secretary, also sent about 1,000 Guard members to the border in 2014 in response to a surge in the number of unaccompanied immigrant children crossing the Rio Grande, the river that separates the U.S. and Mexico in the state.About 100 Guardsmen remain deployed as part of that existing state mission."

It also forbids them from performing tasks of civilian law enforcement unless explicitly authorized, according to the Congressional Research Service.Trump said Thursday that he wants to send 2,000 to 4,000 Guard members to the border to help federal officials fight illegal immigration and drug trafficking. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said on Twitter that she had a ""productive conversation"" about the deployment with governors of the Southwest border states.On Friday, North Dakota's Republican governor joined leaders of some border states in saying he would send forces if asked.The GOP governors of Arizona, New Mexico and Texas also back the plan. California's Democratic governor has been silent on the topic. It's unclear if Trump will ask for troops from states other than those along the border.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders described the deployment as ""a good first step."" If the administration determines that more troops are needed, ""we'll make that decision at that time.""North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum said that if he's asked, he will contribute.""We will answer the call,"" Burgum said. ""From historic floods to more recent events, we North Dakotans know from experience how critical it is for states to support each other in times of need.""Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval, also a Republican, on Friday became one of the latest leaders to oppose the plan. His spokeswoman, Mary-Sarah Kinner, said in an email that Sandoval does not believe the mission would be ""an appropriate use"" of the Nevada Guard.Oregon Gov. Kate Brown has said she would deny Trump's request.""As commander of Oregon's Guard, I'm deeply troubled by Trump's plan to militarize our border,"" Brown tweeted.Her spokesman, Bryan Hockaday, acknowledged she might not have a say if Trump uses the federal code.Trump ""can federalize the National Guard forces, and there's not much the governor can do to prevent that,"" Hockaday said.However, if a National Guard mission were ordered under another federal law called Title 32, the protocol could be different. That law says command and control of National Guard personnel remain with their respective governors, even though the troops generally serve a federal purpose, according to the Congressional Research Service.In that scenario, a governor could try to reject a request for troops or order Guard members to remain in rear staging areas and not participate.While California Gov. Jerry Brown has not spoken publicly about Trump's plan, California National Guard spokesman Lt. Col. Tom Keegan said any request ""will be promptly reviewed to determine how best we can assist our federal partners.""""We look forward to more detail, including funding, duration and end state,"" Keegan said.Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, said Friday that she will consult with the head of the Alabama Guard to see what resources are available.If the deployment happens, it would not be the first time the National Guard has gone to the U.S.-Mexico border.Almost every U.S. state and territory contributed Guard members to Operation Jump Start, announced by President George W. Bush in 2006. Around 30,000 Guard members eventually participated, according to a 2008 National Guard analysis, including more than 1,000 each from Kentucky, North Carolina, and South Carolina.During Operation Phalanx, ordered by President Barack Obama in 2010, 1,200 Guard members deployed to the border, most of them from Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas.In the mid-1980s, National Guard troops were deployed even farther south, in Honduras, where they carried out military maneuvers. The missions happened as Sandinista forces in neighboring Nicaragua battled Contra rebels who were backed by Washington and had clandestine bases in Honduras.___Associated Press writers Doug Glass in Minneapolis, Nomaan Merchant in Dallas and Jonathan Cooper in Sacramento, California, contributed to this report.___Follow Andrew Selsky on Twitter at https://twitter.com/andrewselsky ."

Travis Burch was charged earlier this month at Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo, Texas, with conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman.The photos included 84 people, including 58 active military and 10 former members among the civilians, according to an investigation file obtained by The Associated Press. Most members were in the Air Force, though the group included one U.S. Marine and one current and one former U.S. Navy sailor.The group started in 2012 ""was comprised of members who when going someplace deemed 'cool' or coming up with a 'funny' idea would take a picture of their penis with something related to the location or object in the picture,"" a summary of the investigation said.Defense lawyer Jeremiah J. Sullivan III said no crime was committed and the case was built around what was done privately in a ""jovial, joking spirit"" among consenting adults.""The Air Force has spent well over a year investigating this case all over the globe,"" Sullivan said. ""This was a completely private group that is now embarrassed by Air Force investigators. They're now being publicly shamed for lawfully and voluntarily sharing their penis pictures. It's a private matter.""The partly censored investigation document said Burch told someone not identified that he took his final suggestive selfie at the vice president's residence while assigned to the security detail.Sullivan confirmed Burch was part of the presidential security detail while stationed at Andrews Air Force Base from 2014 to 2016, but said no such photo was shot at the house then occupied by Vice President Joe Biden.""There were never photos taken at the White House or the vice president's house,"" he said. ""We know that for a fact.""One of the charges alleges Burch threatened to share a photo of one member touching Burch's penis if the man didn't send more images.Sullivan rejected that charge and said all the photos were taken consensually and no one was threatened.Burch kept images and videos on an external hard drive found by investigators in a hollowed-out book in his quarters. They also found coins and other prizes that were awarded for completing a series of different poses and other acts.The Air Force acknowledged the misconduct charges, but declined to comment further. Burch faces a hearing to determine if he should be tried by court-martial for any of three counts, including an allegation that he solicited other service members to commit indecent conduct that brought discredit to the armed forces.It was not immediately clear what kind of penalty he could face.Sullivan said an administrative hearing would be more appropriate.Last year, the Navy internally disciplined two pilots who used the contrail behind their fighter jet to draw a penis in the sky over rural Washington. That incident became widely publicized after photos were posted on social media."
b'Teens dreamed of future together before their grisly deaths',http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/04/06/teenagers-in-love-found-slain-at-bottom-old-mine-shaft.html,"SALT LAKE CITY –  They were teenagers in love, bonding after overcoming personal struggles and dreaming of a family and future together. When they vanished days after Christmas, friends and family combed Utah's west desert for months in search of answers.What police eventually discovered was more unspeakable than anyone had imagined: The teens' bound and stabbed bodies were 100 feet (31 meters) down an abandoned mine shaft.""We had every scenario run through our heads, but for the events that truly took place, words can't even describe it,"" said Amanda Hunt, after learning the fates of her 17-year-old niece, Brelynne ""Breezy"" Otteson, and 18-year-old Riley Powell.A man enraged that his girlfriend had welcomed her friends into their home bound, beat and stabbed Powell to death as Otteson watched in horror before he cut her throat, prosecutors said this week.""It's as bad as anything I've ever seen,"" said Utah County Sheriff's Sgt. Spencer Cannon. ""They just seem like decent kids ... they never did anything to deserve this.""Otteson, an outspoken teenager with side-swept hair and bright hazel eyes, had been wrestling for years with her mother's death in a car crash. But she found something special in Powell, her aunt said. Over Thanksgiving the teen was telling her family she might be pregnant.""She struggled with that affection, she struggled with feeling that people loved her, and the same with Riley,"" Hunt said. ""I think they both wanted to be loved.""Powell had his own challenges. He'd been sent to a boys' home after bringing a gun to his high school, though Hunt said he only intended to take it rabbit hunting. He changed schools, graduated and found work as a plumber.The couple was living with Powell's father in Eureka, a former silver mining town with a wind-swept main street surrounded by sandy-colored hills pockmarked with hundreds of abandoned mine shafts about 75 miles (120 kilometers) south of Salt Lake City.Sturdily built with glasses and a goatee, Powell often played basketball or went riding off-road growing up. At one point, Hunt said he'd briefly dated a woman named Morgan Henderson.The two remained friends, and made plans to meet at her house and smoke marijuana at around midnight on Dec. 30, police say, after Powell and Otteson wrapped up Christmas celebrations with her family.Investigators pieced together a scenario of what happened next, according to court documents and statements Henderson gave to authorities:The couple met Henderson, 34, at a home she was sharing with a 41-year-old boyfriend named Jarrod Baum near Eureka. He'd been in and out of jail since robbing a Burger King at age 15, said Cannon, who booked him into jail back then.He had warned Henderson against having male friends over, and when he arrived home and found the teenagers there he exploded, she said. He tied them up, duct-taped their mouths and threw them in the back of Powell's Jeep. He told Henderson to get in.They drove a few miles outside town and stopped in front of a mine shaft wide enough to swallow a car and nearly 2,000 feet (609 meters) deep.Baum pulled the teenagers out of the Jeep and led them to the abandoned mine, at one point congratulating them on her pregnancy. While Otteson had hoped have a baby, investigators later found she wasn't pregnant. It's not clear why Baum mentioned it.He made her kneel and watch as he beat and stabbed Riley Powell to death, police said, before Baum sliced her throat and tossed her down the mine after him.The bodies stayed there for months as family and friends combed the desert, descending into several of the abandoned mines around Eureka. Searchers even stood over the pit known as the Tintic Standard Mine No. 2, but didn't go down because it was too deep for their team, Hunt said.Henderson, meanwhile, told police she hadn't seen the couple. A break came March 25, when Henderson was pulled over with weapons in her car and arrested. She eventually told police the story of what happened and led them to the bodies.Baum is facing aggravated murder, kidnapping and other charges that could bring the death penalty, while Henderson is charged with obstruction of justice. No attorneys were available to comment for Baum or Henderson, and there were no working publicly listed phone numbers for them.At a hearing Tuesday, Baum turned and locked eyes with the teens' heartbroken families.""He just looked empty,"" Hunt said. ""Soulless."""
"b'Diocese IDs priests, bishop, laypeople in abuse probe'",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/04/06/catholic-diocese-ids-priests-and-lay-people-accused-abuse.html,"ERIE, Pa. –  The Roman Catholic Diocese of Erie, Pennsylvania, on Friday made public the names of 34 priests or other members of the clergy who faced credible allegations of sexual abuse or misconduct over the years, including their bishop in the 1970s, who they say failed to stop abuse that was reported to him.In an unusual step, the diocese also identified 17 lay men and women facing similar claims, including a Catholic high school teacher who went on to become a college president.It's the first time the sprawling 13-county, 202,000-member diocese in the state's northwest corner has put out a comprehensive list of those accused of abuse, which ranged from providing children with pornography to sexual assault.""As Catholics, we believe the Lord has infinite mercy and absolution for those who are contrite and sincerely seek forgiveness,"" Bishop Lawrence Persico said. ""But that does not mean they are free from the ramifications of their behavior.""The allegations reach back seven decades. Twenty-one of the priests and two of the laypeople on the list are deceased. None are now serving in any capacity with the church.The document put out by the diocese lists where most of those named are believed to be living, and any punishment they have received, from being removed from the priesthood to being sent to prison, which was the case for a handful of the laypeople.Bishop Alfred Watson, who led the diocese until the early 1980s, is cited for allegedly failing to act to stop abuse that was deemed to have been credibly reported to him. He died in 1990.William Garvey, who died last year, had faced accusations he abused minors while he was a lay high school teacher and basketball coach. He would go on to become president of Mercyhurst College in Erie.The diocese's decision to put out the list came as the Pennsylvania Attorney General's office is wrapping up a grand jury investigation into how the Erie diocese and five others in Pennsylvania have handled abuse and other allegations over the years.The church said it is tightening its policies to protect children from future abuse, including increasing the clearances needed to work with youth.Law enforcement is currently investigating three people not on the list of 51, including two priests who were identified by the diocese back in February and have either resigned or been removed from the church, the diocese said.Diocesan spokeswoman Anne-Marie Welsh said staff had begun looking into allegations dating as far back as 1944 even before the grand jury investigation began in 2016.She said Persico, who became bishop in 2012, invited local prosecutors to look at the diocese's files early in his tenure but that process was suspended once the state investigation began.The Erie diocese's list is different from most of the other lists released by dioceses around the country because it includes the names of laypeople who worked with Catholic schools or as volunteers with churches or affiliated agencies, the bishop said.About 35 of 145 dioceses in the U.S., or roughly 25 percent, have released names of credibly accused priests, including two others in Pennsylvania, according to the group BishopAccountability.org.Terry McKiernan, its president, said naming laypeople was unusual.""There are various ways the dioceses reduce the number on their list, so increasing the number by including laypeople is a positive step and might be unique in these lists,"" McKiernan said, adding that his group has called on the dioceses to include comprehensive work histories for the accused as well.Jeff Anderson, a St. Paul, Minnesota, lawyer whose firm only handles cases of abuse survivors, said the diocese has made a ""pre-emptive minimal effort"" in light of the grand jury investigation.___This story has been corrected to show that 21 clergymen are deceased, not 20."
"b""Massachusetts' ban on assault weapons doesn't violate 2nd Amendment, judge rules""",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/04/06/massachusetts-ban-on-assault-weapons-doesnt-violate-2nd-amendment-judge-rules.html,"Security expert Aaron Cohen provides insight on 'The Ingraham Angle' after school shooting in Broward County, Florida.A judge in Massachusetts on Friday ruled against a lawsuit that questioned the state’s ban on assault weapons and large-capacity magazines, declaring that the weapons were not protected by the Second Amendment.Assault weapons are considered to be military firearms, U.S. District Judge William Young said in his ruling, therefore disqualifying them from being included in a citizen’s right to “bear arms.”Policy makers, rather than the courts, were better suited to decide on the regulation for the weapons, he said.""Other states are equally free to leave them unregulated and available to their law-abiding citizens,"" Young said in his ruling. ""These policy matters are simply not of constitutional moment. Americans are not afraid of bumptious, raucous and robust debate about these matters. We call it democracy.""WHERE DOES TRUMP STAND ON GUN CONTROL? A LOOK AT THE PRESIDENT’S VIEWSThe lawsuit was filed against state Attorney General Maura Healey last year by the Gun Owners’ Action League of Massachusetts, among other parties, who claimed that AR-15s couldn’t be considered a “military weapon” because of their inability to shoot in fully automatic mode. They also claimed the ban infringed on Second Amendment rights.That notion was ruled out, however, as the judge pointed out that the design of semi-automatic AR-15's is based on guns ""that were first manufactured for military purposes"" and that the AR-15 is ""common and well-known in the military.""""The AR-15 and its analogs, along with large capacity magazines, are simply not weapons within the original meaning of the individual constitutional right to 'bear arms,'"" Young said.GUN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS HAND OUT HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES AT VERMONT RALLYThe decision was championed by Healey, who said the judge’s decision “vindicates the right of the people of Massachusetts to protect themselves from these weapons of war and my office’s efforts to enforce the law.”“Strong gun laws save lives,” she continued “and we will not be intimidated by the gun lobby in our efforts to end the sale of assault weapons and protect our communities and schools. Families across the country should take heart in this victory.”The ruling in Massachusetts follows an ongoing debate about AR-15s, due in part to their use in shootings such as the violent spree in Parkland, Florida on Valentine’s Day that left 17 people were dead. Authorities said the shooter, Nikolas Cruz, used an AR-15 during the deadly assault.STUDENTS HOLD SECOND AMENDMENT RALLY TO COUNTER WALKOUT PUSHING FOR STRICTER GUN LAWSYoung also upheld Healey's 2016 enforcement notice to gun sellers and manufacturers clarifying what constitutes a ""copy"" or ""duplicate"" weapon under the 1998 assault weapon ban, including copies of the Colt AR-15 and the Kalashnikov AK-47.The Massachusetts assault weapons ban mirrors the federal ban that expired in 2004. It bans the sale of specific and name-brand weapons and explicitly bans copies or duplicates of those weapons.Fox News’ Bill Mears and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
b'Gun store employee says YouTube shooter did not stand out',http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/04/06/store-worker-says-youtube-shooter-gun-buy-did-not-stand-out.html,"SAN DIEGO –  An employee at a San Diego gun store where a woman bought the pistol used to shoot three people at YouTube headquarters said there was nothing remarkable about the transaction, a newspaper reports.Manny Mendoza, rangemaster at The Gun Range, said that the woman now widely known for posting prolific and bizarre videos on exercise, animal cruelty and veganism was not memorable.""It's not like she stood out,"" Mendoza said to the Bay Area News Group. ""I wish we could look into someone's soul.""Nasim Aghdam, an Iranian native in her late 30s, walked through a parking garage into a courtyard at the YouTube campus Tuesday and opened fire, police said. She wounded three people before killing herself.San Bruno Police Commander Geoff Caldwell said Aghdam legally bought the 9mm handgun Jan. 16, and it was registered in her name. She was found with two magazines and the pistol.Authorities and family members say she was angry about the policies and practices of the company.She posted videos under the online name Nasime Sabz, and a website in that name decried YouTube's policies, saying the company was trying to ""suppress"" content creators.Aghdam took the pistol from the store the same day that the world's biggest online video website announced stricter requirements for video producers to make money from views of their videos.Her family has expressed shock and sorrow at the shootings, and said they warned law enforcement that she might be headed to YouTube and that she ""hated"" the company.""Right now I'm thinking, she never hurt one ant. How (could) she shoot the people?"" said her father, Ismail Aghdam, said in an interview with Good Morning America that aired Friday.The family showed ABC News the sparsely furnished bedroom where she produced videos in which she exercised, promoted animal rights and explained the vegan diet, often wearing elaborate costumes or carrying a rabbit.Ismail Aghdam reported his daughter missing on Monday.Mountain View police encountered her sleeping in a car around 2 a.m. Tuesday, but had no reason to detain her. They say family members never said she could become violent or post a threat to YouTube employees.San Bruno police say she practiced shooting at a local gun range on Tuesday before driving to YouTube headquarters.Of three people wounded by gunshots, a 36-year-old man initially classified as critically injured remained hospitalized Friday in fair condition."
