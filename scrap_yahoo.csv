b'Israel Reverses Course Hours After Signing U.N. Deal To Resettle African Migrants',https://www.yahoo.com/news/israel-reverses-course-hours-signing-000847273.html,"Less than a day after the Israeli government announced a deal with the United Nations’ refugee agency to resettle more than 16,000 African migrants and grant legal status to others, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suspended and then definitively scrapped the deal. Early on Monday, the Israeli government and the U.N. agency, formally known as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, revealed the outlines of a deal they’d signed concerning the status of more than 34,000 undocumented Eritreans and Sudanese living in Israel. Under the agreement, more than 16,000 would resettle in other countries, largely in Europe. The rest would receive legal status in Israel.By Monday night, however, Netanyahu had walked back the announcement, saying on Facebook that the deal would be put on hold until further review. On Tuesday, he announced the deal was dead.“I have listened carefully to the many comments on the agreement. As a result, and after I again weighed the advantages and disadvantages, I decided to cancel the deal,” Netanyahu said, according to a statement.The Israeli prime minister’s reversal came after a backlash from right-wing politicians and some residents of southern Tel Aviv, where many Eritreans and Sudanese have settled.Most of the Eritrean and Sudanese people living in Israel have fled war and persecution in their countries of origin. The area of southern Tel Aviv, where many reside, is “economically challenged” with “unemployment and social tension,” UNHCR spokesperson William Spindler told HuffPost on Monday.Spindler said that Eritrean and Sudanese people in Israel should be considered refugees, not migrants, as they left their homes to escape persecution and war. He also noted that Israel, as the receiving nation, has only in a very few cases processed and officially designated the migrants as refugees.“It is with regret that UNHCR notes cancellation by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of the Israel-UNHCR Agreement,” the U.N. agency wrote in a statement on Tuesday. “We encourage the Government of Israel to consider the matter further, while standing ready to be of help.”The deal between Israel and the UNHCR, which was to be carried out over the next five years, had rested on the agency’s ability to relocate some 16,000 of the refugees to “developed” countries where the agency has resettlement programs ― including in Europe, the U.S., Canada and Australia, Spindler told HuffPost. As of Monday, no country had officially agreed to take in any of those refugees.  The agreement had also included support services for the African migrants who would be staying legally in Israel, Spindler said, including vocational training to help them find employment beyond southern Tel Aviv.Per the agreement, Israel would no longer pursue its “non-voluntary relocation policy,” according to a U.N. release.Earlier this year, Israel had announced a plan to force undocumented African migrants to “voluntarily” leave the country by the end of March or risk being detained. The plan would provide $3,500 to migrants to relocate to countries in sub-Saharan Africa. At the time, the UNHCR criticized the policy as one that left migrants in unsafe conditions. Israel’s high court blocked the policy’s implementation through a temporary order in mid-March.This article has been updated to reflect Tuesday’s cancellation of the deal."
b'Ted Kennedy and Chappaquiddick: A new film looks at the accident that ended a political dynasty',https://www.yahoo.com/news/ted-kennedy-chappaquiddick-new-film-looks-accident-ended-political-dynasty-110035644.html,"One of the great mysteries of 20th century American politics is being resurrected in a new film that takes its title from a byword for political and sexual scandal: Chappaquiddick.The film, directed by John Curran, tells the story of the death of Mary Jo Kopechne, a young woman who died in Sen. Edward “Ted” Kennedy’s car after it crashed on a small island off Martha’s Vineyard in the summer of 1969. Those facts are among the few certainties in a decades-long mystery. With Kennedy a favorite at the time for the Democratic nomination for president in 1972, the shadow cast by Chappaquiddick may well have changed the course of American political history.The conspiracy theories and innuendo dwarf the undisputed facts of the event. What’s known is that Kopechne, who was 28, and Kennedy, 37, were at a party for staffers from Robert F. Kennedy’s 1968 campaign on Chappaquiddick on the night of July 18, 1969. They were at a cottage on the island and at some point in the evening Kopechne (portrayed by Kate Mara) and Kennedy (Jason Clarke) left the party, with Kennedy driving his Oldsmobile 88. Kennedy’s car went off a narrow bridge leading to a private beach, overturned, and submerged in Poucha Pond. Kennedy returned to his Edgartown hotel on Martha’s Vineyard, where he briefly spoke to the manager of the Shiretown Inn at 2:25 a.m.The next morning two fishermen found the car and called the authorities, who found Kopechne’s body still in the car in several feet of water. Kennedy returned to Chappaquiddick to make calls on a pay phone before heading to the Edgartown sheriff’s office to report the incident. Over the course of the next week, the senator from Massachusetts attended Kopechne’s funeral in Pennsylvania, pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident (for which he received a suspended sentence) and gave a nationally televised address to the nation in which he asked his constituents to write letters and let him know if he should resign. Public opinion was positive enough that Kennedy stayed in office while prosecutors decided not to charge him with negligent driving or involuntary manslaughter.Slideshow: Chappaquiddick: A tragedy that changed the course of American history >>>Everything else is subject to at least some level of interpretation, as certain elements of the story either changed over time or were never told. Here are answers to some of the questions viewers may have:Where was Kennedy in his political career?Kennedy was initially elected to the Senate at age 30, in a 1962 special election to fill the seat of his brother John, who had resigned after winning the presidency in 1960. He subsequently won a full term in 1964 with 75 percent of the vote and was considered a frontrunner for the Democratic nomination for the presidency in 1972 following the assassination of his other brother, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, during the 1968 primary campaign. Sen. Edmund Muskie of Maine, a Democrat who would compete in the 1972 primary, said after Kopechne’s death that Kennedy could have had the nomination “for the asking,” but that “the controversy may have brought about an unfortunate shift in his fortunes.”Six months before the crash, he had become the youngest majority whip in the history of the Senate. In his reelection campaign 16 months after the events of Chappaquiddick, his share of the vote went down to 64 percent, and he lost his position as whip in January 1971. He turned down an offer to be the vice presidential candidate on George McGovern’s ticket in 1972 and failed in an effort to unseat sitting President Jimmy Carter in 1980. He held his seat until his death in 2009, the fourth longest tenure of any U.S. senator. Members of the next generation of Kennedys have gone on to serve in Congress, but the once invincible Kennedy dynasty pretty much died at Chappaquiddick.How did Kennedy get out of the car, and why did he wait so long to alert authorities?Kennedy said in his official statement and at the inquest that he didn’t remember how he got out of the car, but that he made multiple attempts to save Kopechne, fighting against a strong current. He attributed his actions in the following hours to shock, exhaustion and a concussion.Kennedy said he brought two friends from the cottage for unsuccessful efforts to rescue Kopechne. But on the walk back to the cottage he would have passed a house where he could have called for help. After the failed attempts, Kennedy told the inquest he didn’t call for further help because he assumed Kopechne had already drowned. Kennedy claims he then swam the channel back to Edgartown, where he was seen by a hotel employee at 2:25 a.m. The Shiretown Inn manager said that Kennedy was dressed in a suit jacket and slacks but looked “distressed.” The next morning, Kennedy talked to friends and made calls from a pay phone before going to the police station around 10 a.m.Why were Kopechne and Kennedy in the car alone?Kennedy’s chauffeur, Jack Crimmins, had remained at the party at the cottage. Kennedy said he was driving Kopechne to the Edgartown ferry but took a wrong turn. That claim has been met with skepticism since the moment it was given in an official statement to the police Saturday morning, July 19. The road to the ferry was paved and went off to the left; Kennedy turned right, past a drop of several inches and onto a dirt road leading to the bridge. Across the bridge was a private beach that Kennedy, Kopechne and others had visited earlier in the day.The timing of events also cast doubt on Kennedy’s account. The last ferry to Edgartown was at midnight, but Deputy Sheriff Christopher Look said he saw Kennedy’s car at 12:40 a.m. Sylvia Malm, who was renting a home 150 yards from the Dike Bridge, said she was reading until midnight the evening of the accident, with an open window facing in the direction of the bridge, and heard nothing. There has been speculation ever since that Kennedy and Kopechne were heading for a tryst. The senator, who was married with three children at the time, was a known womanizer but denied any “immoral conduct” with Kopechne.Was Kennedy drunk at the time of the accident?Kennedy claimed he only had a “couple” of drinks the night of the accident, but as with his womanizing, the senator’s reputation as a heavy drinker preceded him. Witnesses reported Kennedy drinking heavily earlier in the day after a sailboat race, and there was a large amount of booze purchased for the cottage gathering, although attendees claimed that neither Kennedy nor Kopechne drank much that night. Those attendees — mostly young female staffers who had worked on the RFK campaign and middle-aged, married men — left the cottage the morning after the accident, before they could be questioned by police. If Kennedy was drunk when the car went off Dike Bridge, it would possibly explain his reluctance to immediately call the authorities to the scene.As for Kopechne, a blood test taken after her death showed her blood alcohol content to be 0.09. This would be just above the legal limit of 0.08.How exactly did Kopechne die?The medical examiner found that the cause of death was drowning, but the Edgartown Fire and Rescue diver who retrieved her body said that he believed it could have been suffocation, as Kopechne had positioned herself in a pocket of air and was potentially alive for hours before running out of oxygen. The funeral director told the inquest that Kopechne had bloodstains on the back of her blouse, which were never explained. No autopsy was performed, although there were several attempts to exhume the corpse in order to complete one.How did Kopechne’s family react to her death?The Kopechnes initially didn’t blame Kennedy for their daughter’s death and said they would support him for president, with Mrs. Kopechne adding that she didn’t think he should give up his Senate seat. They reached a financial settlement with Kennedy for a sum that was initially reported to be in excess of $150,000 but was later said to be just over $90,000 — or $600,000 in 2018 dollars. Two decades after the accident, the Kopechnes expressed anger and frustration at Kennedy, at the media for dragging their daughter’s name “through the mud,” and at the other female RFK staffers who didn’t speak out after the incident. Kopechne’s father added that the only positive from the accident was that “Mary Jo’s death kept the senator from becoming president.”Is there any chance Kopechne was driving? Some have suggested that Kennedy wasn’t even in the car at the time of the accident. The theory is that when Deputy Sheriff Look spotted the Oldsmobile, Kennedy panicked about being seen with Kopechne, left the car and told her to drive away and pick him up later. Unfamiliar with both the large automobile and dirt road, Kopechne crashed on her own. That would explain Kennedy’s miraculous escape (he wasn’t in the car to begin with) and his lack of injuries (people who spoke with him the next morning said he didn’t seem to be suffering the effects of the claimed concussion). There is a version of this theory that purports to explain why Kennedy didn’t report the incident until hours later — because he didn’t know it had occurred.How accurate is the film’s depiction of the events?Of necessity, the film takes dramatic license in depicting the behind-the-scenes maneuvers of Kennedy’s crisis-management team, including former JFK speechwriter Ted Sorensen and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, for which there are no undisputed public accounts. There is also the mystery of what Kennedy did during the time between the accident and showing up at the Edgartown police station. (Investigators found calls were made, but couldn’t tell to whom.) The film depicts conversations in which Kennedy tries to persuade Kopechne to take a job in his Senate office, events never described by Kennedy in public.One major departure from history appears to be the film’s portrayal of Joe Kennedy Sr. (Bruce Dern), Ted Kennedy’s father. Kennedy Sr. had suffered a number of strokes and would die four months after Chappaquiddick; by most accounts he was essentially unable to communicate. But in the film he is capable of speaking limited words, writing messages to his son and at one point slapping him. The film also shows him watching his son’s primetime speech, whereas the elder Kennedy’s nurse specifically said in an interview he didn’t watch it. The film also makes some small alterations to the record as recounted by Kennedy or his confidants. Joe Gargan (Ed Helms), a cousin of the senator and one of the men who attempted to rescue Kopechne the night of the accident, confirmed Kennedy’s account that the senator swam the channel back to Edgartown after the accident. In Chappaquiddick, he is rowed over to town in a small boat by Gargan._____Read more from Yahoo News:"
b'First Person Sentenced In Robert Mueller&apos;s Russia Investigation',https://www.yahoo.com/news/first-person-sentenced-robert-mueller-160349927.html,"WASHINGTON ― A federal judge on Tuesday sentenced Alex van der Zwaan to 30 days in prison, a $20,000 fine and two months’ supervised release, making him the first person to be sentenced as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into whether President Donald Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia in the 2016 election.Van der Zwaan, an attorney who formerly worked at the high-powered law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, pleaded guilty in February of lying to the FBI about his communications with Rick Gates, a top aide to former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort.Both Gates and Manafort have been charged in Mueller’s probe with lying to investigators and conspiracy, tied to Manafort’s work as a lobbyist for pro-Russia politicians in Ukraine.Documents filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington last week claimed that Gates and van der Zwaan had communicated with a former Russian intelligence officer in the months leading up to the 2016 election. That individual, identified only as “Person A” in the filings from Mueller’s team, is believed to be Konstantin Kilimnik, who worked for Manafort’s lobbying firm in Ukraine, according to Reuters.“What I did was wrong. I apologize to the court for my conduct,” van der Zwaan said in a short statement at his sentencing hearing.Van der Zwaan’s lawyers asked for no jail time, noting that his wife is pregnant.“His career has been destroyed, he has been separated from his friends and family, and he faces the possibility of missing the birth of his first child. Although Alex committed a serious offense, just punishment does not require incarceration,” his attorneys wrote last week.In February, Gates pleaded guilty to the charges against him and is now cooperating with Mueller’s investigation.Manafort pleaded not guilty and faces a trial later this year."
b'Trump lashes out at &apos;little&apos; CNN executive \xe2\x80\x94 and the network fires back',https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-lashes-little-cnn-executive-network-fires-back-142103174.html,"President Trump lashed out at television news networks on Tuesday for having a supposedly “sick and biased” agenda while defending the Sinclair Broadcast Group.The president’s latest caustic attack against the media came amid revelations that Sinclair, which owns local TV stations across the country, required local news anchors to warn viewers of “the troubling trend of irresponsible, one-sided news stories plaguing our country.” Trump then zeroed in on the cable channel that has become his favorite foil: CNN.“The Fake News Networks, those that knowingly have a sick and biased AGENDA, are worried about the competition and quality of Sinclair Broadcast,” Trump tweeted. “The ‘Fakers’ at CNN, NBC, ABC & CBS have done so much dishonest reporting that they should only be allowed to get awards for fiction!”Trump directed his Twitter fire at CNN executive Jeff Zucker, who played a key role at NBC in boosting Trump’s reality show, “The Apprentice.” But Trump, who’s had trouble with spelling, didn’t appear to remember how to spell Zucker’s last name.“Check out the fact that you can’t get a job at ratings challenged @CNN unless you state that you are totally anti-Trump,” the president continued before misspelling the name of CNN’s chief executive. “Little Jeff Zuker [sic], whose job is in jeopardy, is not having much fun lately. They should clean up and strengthen CNN and get back to honest reporting!”CNN quickly responded in tweets replying to Trump.“Once again, false,” the network’s public relations department tweeted. “The personal political beliefs of CNN’s employees are of no interest to us. Their pursuit of the truth is our only concern. Also, Jeff’s last name is spelled Z-U-C-K-E-R. Those are the facts. #FactsFirst.”“As for ‘challenged,’ CNN just finished its second highest rated first quarter in the past nine years,” it continued. “Those are the facts. #FactsFirst”CNN’s PR department then tweeted a link to a recent poll that found President Trump is “less trusted than the major cable news outlets as an information source.”Trump’s long-running feud with CNN predates his presidency. During the 2016 campaign, Trump often complained about the network’s coverage of his candidacy — singling out CNN’s cameras at his rallies and suggesting that Zucker would not have been hired by CNN if it were not for him.The constant attacks continued during the transition. At his formal first press conference as president-elect, Trump berated CNN’s Jim Acosta as he attempted to ask a question, labeling Acosta and the network “fake news.”And it has spilled over throughout his first 15 months in office. Last summer, Trump infamously shared a superimposed wrestling video of himself slamming CNN to the ground.Read more from Yahoo News:(Cover Photo Credit: Yahoo News photo Illustration; photos: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP, Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images)"

He faces charges of second-degree murder, aggravated battery, and aggravated endangerment of a child.Schooley played a major role in the creation of Verrückt, a 168-foot-high waterslide that decapitated Caleb Schwab on Aug. 7, 2016, at Schlitterbahn Waterpark, authorities alleged. He was responsible for doing “the math” that went into Verrückt’s design, but had “no engineering credentials relevant to amusement ride design or safety,” according to a lawsuit against the park filed by the state of Kansas last month.At least 10 other Schlitterbahn customers had been hurt riding Verrückt before Caleb’s death, according to the lawsuit, including broken toes and concussions.A Kansas grand jury last month indicted Schooley along with the water park, its construction company, park co-owner Jeffrey Henry and former director of operations Tyler Miles on criminal charges in Caleb’s death. Miles pleaded not guilty last month to involuntary manslaughter. Henry is scheduled to enter a plea to a second-degree murder charge on Thursday, according to The San Antonio Express-News.Schlitterbahn has denied wrongdoing, and defended Miles, Henry and Schooley in a statement last week.“Jeff Henry has designed waterpark rides the world over,” the statement said. “Nearly every waterpark that exists today has an attraction or feature based on his designs or ideas.

b'Democrats Score Big Win In Wisconsin Supreme Court Race',https://www.yahoo.com/news/democrats-score-big-win-wisconsin-020421503.html,"Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Rebecca Dallet won a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court Tuesday, a victory for Democrats that gives more momentum for a potential blue wave in the November midterm elections. State Supreme Court races rarely merit national attention. The Wisconsin election ― which gives justices a 10-year term ― was officially nonpartisan, but it was crystal clear where the partisan lines formed. It’s the first time in 23 years that a liberal candidate won an open Supreme Court seat in the state. Dallet won by nearly 12 percentage points. Dallet picked up endorsements from former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), while former Attorney General Eric Holder went to the state to campaign for her. Dallet defeated Sauk County Circuit Judge Michael Screnock, an appointee of Gov. Scott Walker (R) who had his own big-time backing from the National Rifle Association.“We beat the NRA, and we beat the millions in special interest money that flowed into our state,” Dallet said in her victory speech Tuesday night.Conservatives will still control the court, although their majority drops from 5-2 to 4-3 with Dallet’s win.Walker tweeted that the results in the race showed Democrats clearly had momentum on their side. Tonight’s results show we are at risk of a #BlueWave in WI. The Far Left is driven by anger & hatred -- we must counter it with optimism & organization. Let’s share our positive story with voters & win in November.During the campaign, the two candidate criticized each other as beholden to outside interests and for being activist judges.Outside groups spent more than $2 million on the race, about evenly split between the two sides. With Dallet’s win, six of the seven justices on Wisconsin’s high court are women, as DailyKos noted, meaning the state ties with Washington for the greatest number of female Supreme Court justices. These days, every state legislative race and special election ― which in other cycles might go by unnoticed ― is getting extra attention because of the message the results may send about what will happen in November. Democrats, stunned by their losses in 2016, have thrown energy into organizing and mobilizing since President Donald Trump’s election. They’ve flipped 39 state legislative seats from red to blue during Trump’s term, plus the governor’s seat in New Jersey, the U.S. Senate seat in Alabama and the 18th Congressional District in Pennsylvania.Republicans, meanwhile, have turned just four state legislative districts from blue to red. In January, Democrats had another big win in Wisconsin: They took a state Senate seat that Republicans had held since 2001. Trump had won the district by 17 percentage points. Republicans have a powerful political machine in Wisconsin, and Democrats recognize that picking up ― and holding onto seats ― in November won’t be easy, especially with Walker on the ballot seeking a third term. But even Walker called Democrats’ surprise win in January a “wake-up call,” and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Republicans should absolutely “pay attention” to the results. “One thing is clear: our voters across Wisconsin are organized and energized for November,” said Martha Laning, chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin."
b'SpaceX Has Launched an Experimental Space Junk Sweeper Into Orbit',https://www.yahoo.com/news/spacex-launched-experimental-space-junk-031056730.html,"Space may be about to get a lot less cluttered.A Monday launch by SpaceX, Elon Musk’s private aerospace company, saw a Falcon 9 rocket lift off from Florida packed with three tons of supplies for the International Space Station (ISS). But the launch — the firm’s 53rd to date — also carried some unconventional cargo: an experimental system known as RemoveDEBRIS, which scientists hope will help clean up Earth’s space junk-littered upper atmosphere, CBS reports.Space junk is a serious problem in Earth’s lower orbit, where there are currently more than 500,000 pieces of defunct satellites, used rocket boosters and other space junk, according to NASA. While many are no larger than a marble, they still pose a threat to satellites and other orbiting structures: In 2015, a rogue piece of an old Russian weather satellite barreling along at eight miles per second forced astronauts in the ISS to take temporary shelter.Scientists hope RemoveDEBRIS will help. The system, developed by the U.K.’s University of Surrey Space Center (SSC) and co-funded by the European Commission, will be assembled by ISS astronauts before being deployed for a few tests to see how well it captures miniature satellites and pulls them out of orbit.Read more: You Should Worry (a Little) About Falling Space DebrisThe first trial will involve firing a net to capture the satellites, which “is a very flexible option because even if the debris is spinning, or has got an irregular shape, to capture it with a net is relatively low-risk” compared to retrieving debris using a robotic arm, according to Guglielmo Aglietti, director at the SSC.Another test will involve a retractable harpoon, which is “maybe simpler” but “a bit more risky because you have to hit your debris in a place that is suitable,”Aglietti said. “Clearly, you have to avoid any fuel tanks.”"

Schools across the country have enforced similar rules since at least the Columbine High School massacre in 1999.But Stoneman Douglas students — many of whom have led a national call for stricter gun control — say the measure is only window dressing and does not actually address the problem of gun violence.“I hate the backpacks, and I think they solve nothing,” Alyssa Goldfarb, a 16-year-old sophomore, told Vice News. “It’s more of a way of the county saying, ‘Hey, we’re doing something.’”As students pushed back against the new backpack rule this week, Robert Runcie, the superintendent of Broward County Public Schools, said the policy was “an initial measure, not a permanent one.”He told the Sun-Sentinel that the district may eventually allow other backpacks and that officials were determining the best methods to keep students safe in the long term, including the possible use of metal-detecting wands.A district spokeswoman told the paper that officials were still exploring the idea of using such wands. “No decision or date has been set for [their] use,” she said.The people with the power to make changes keep making the wrong changes; no matter how much we tell them to listen to us there will always be a backpack manufacturer saying, ""Hey they need clear backpacks, we got you covered,""...My new backpack is almost as transparent as the NRA’s agenda.

We reject it utterly because it is not certain that there is a caravan of Hondurans,"" the minister in charge of cabinet executive affairs, Ebal Diaz, said in a statement sent to AFP.Trump on Monday tweeted that ""Honduras, Mexico and many other countries that the U.S. is very generous to, sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES. Caravans are heading here. Must pass tough laws and build the WALL.""He followed up on Tuesday with another tweet reading: ""The big Caravan of People from Honduras, now coming across Mexico and heading to our 'Weak Laws' Border, had better be stopped before it gets there. Cash cow NAFTA is in play, as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen. Congress MUST ACT NOW!""An estimated 1,500 people from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras are walking north towards the US border in an annual event that was both a protest over conditions faced by migrants and as a way for migrants to safely reach the border.Trump has accused Mexico of abetting and profiting from illegal immigration, and is threatening to use negotiations over the North American Free Trade Agreement as a bargaining chip on the issue.Diaz accused Trump of using Honduras ""to pressure the (US) Congress to approve reforms on migration law.""""Honduras is the country that has done the most to create suitable conditions so that our compatriots do not leave the country,"" Diaz added.He said Honduras has also made progress on fighting crime and the conditions that spur emigration.""Unfortunately, as long as the United States does not stop and does not really do things to stop drug consumption, violence will keep affecting those countries"" on drug trafficking routes to America, Diaz said.According to the Honduran government, violence linked to cocaine trafficking from South America to the US market is one of the biggest causes of people wanting to leave the country."

We are not aiming at isolating Russia,"" Stoltenberg said in remarks at the University of Ottawa.Stoltenberg said NATO was concerned by a more assertive Russia that he said had annexed Crimea, destabilized eastern Ukraine, backed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and meddled in the affairs of other nations.""That was the reason why NATO allies and partners reacted the way they reacted after the attack in Salisbury. Because that is not a single event,"" he said. ""It is an attack which has taken place (against) the backdrop of a pattern of behavior which we have seen over many years from Russia.""More than 100 Russian diplomats have been expelled by Western countries to punish the Kremlin over the March 4 attack in Salisbury, England.NATO suspended all practical military and civilian cooperation with Russia after the 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.Stoltenberg later met Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose government expelled four diplomats after the Salisbury attack.Trudeau, speaking to reporters after the meeting, complained that Russia was spreading a ""wave of interference and propaganda"" against the roughly 450 Canadian troops stationed in Latvia as part of a NATO mission.Trudeau also said Canada would ""continue to reflect on the impact and the efficiency of sanctions"" and was open to more discussions on what else it could do.Trudeau, who did not give more details, noted that Canada enacted a law last year allowing the government to penalize those it says are guilty of human rights violations.In November, Ottawa used the law to impose sanctions against 30 Russian officials who it said were complicit in the 2009 prison death of Sergei Magnitsky, an anti-corruption lawyer who was jailed after alleging a massive tax fraud.(Reporting by David Ljunggren; Editing by Susan Thomas and Peter Cooney)"

Three people suffered gunshot wounds and one believed to have an ankle injury, according to San Bruno Police Chief Ed Barberini.After reports of gunshots poured in and sent police to the YouTube campus, responding officers arrived to see “numerous employees” attempting to flee, Mr Barberini said.“It was very chaotic,” he said. Mr Barberini could not comment on whether the suspect was a YouTube employee. He said the suspect was using a handgun but could not confirm the make or model.“We know very, very little right now”, he said.As officers cleared the scene in the ensuing hours, employees with stunned expressions and wearing Google-branded clothing steadily trickled off the campus and past police cars with their lights flashing. Some paused to embrace one another.Multiple witnesses described scenes of confusion as people heard a series of pops and realised they were listening to gunfire.“It was kind of a blur,” software engineer Sepand Parhami said, describing seeing blood trickling down a flight of stairs. “I don’t think it’s anything I ever really expected.”Mr Barberini told reporters that at least one of the injured had been found on the campus. At least two others were found in adjacent buildings.A spokesman for San Francisco General Hospital said it received three patients. Spokesman Brent Andrew said a 36-year-old man is in a critical condition, a 32-year-old woman was in a serious condition and a 27-year-old woman was in a fair condition.Was just briefed on the shooting at YouTube’s HQ in San Bruno, California. Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved. Thank you to our phenomenal Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders that are currently on the scene.The confirmation that the woman had been found dead brought to an end several hours of intense drama during which police and federal agents swarmed the company’s headquarters as multiple 911 calls reported gunfire.Television news footage showed people leaving the building in a line, holding their arms in the air for police to inspect as they were leaving the building. Officers patted down people to make sure none had weapons and police vehicles surrounded the areaYouTube employee Vadim Lavrusik posted on Twitter that he heard gunshots and saw people running, according to the Associated Press. He said he was barricaded in a room with his co-workers before being safely evacuated.Will Hudson said a friend who works for YouTube texted him about the shooter.“I think there might be a shooter in my building,” read one text. “The fire alarm went off so we started to evacuate and then people (started) running saying there was a shooter.”Northern California’s Stanford Hospital said it has received four to five patients, but a hospital spokeswoman did not have information on their conditions or their wounds.Google, which owns the world’s biggest online video website, posted on Twitter that the company was coordinating with the authorities. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also said it had responded to the shooting at the tech firm’s campus.The White House said Donald Trump was briefed on a shooting and that officials were monitoring it.Mr Hudson said his friend made it safely back to San Francisco and was in contact with his family.“It just feels strange. It feels like it could really be anyone. That’s really the strangeness of it,” he said.Mr Barberini said police would be working around the clock on the scene as the investigation into what may have motivated the shooter is still unclear. ""We have our crime lab folks out here and we have the coroner out here. It will be a long night,"" he said.YouTube spokesman Chris Dale said the company’s “incredibly tight-knit community” was reeling, adding that “today it feels like the entire community of YouTube were victims of a crime""."

b'17 States Sue Trump Administration Over Census Citizenship Question',https://www.yahoo.com/news/18-states-sue-trump-administration-160424692.html,"New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman (D) filed a federal lawsuit on Tuesday aimed at blocking the Trump administration from adding a question about citizenship to the 2020 census, saying such a question violates the U.S. Constitution’s mandate to count all persons.In a statement, Schneiderman’s office said the suit was filed on behalf of 17 states plus the District of Columbia, six cities and the U.S. Conference of Mayors. It comes a little over a week after the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, announced it would add the question. Schneiderman said the decision to add a citizenship question “blatantly” undermined the Constitution’s mandate to count all people.“The prospect of someone saying, ‘I am from the Trump administration’ knocking on your door to ask a question about citizenship would understandably provoke real fear,” Schneiderman said during a Tuesday press conference, flanked by members of New York’s congressional delegation.The numbers from the census are used to determine how many seats each state gets in Congress, as well as how hundreds of billions of dollars in federal funds are allocated. Democratic members of New York’s congressional delegation said Tuesday that the decision to add a citizenship question was an attack on states, like New York, with high immigrant populations in an attempt to cut their congressional representation and share of federal funding.“It is being added to harm states and cities like New York both politically and financially,” said Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.). “We are being unfairly targeted because we have large, diverse immigrant populations which we welcome and support.”Civil rights groups voiced loud opposition to adding the question, noting that the bureau has not tested the question and that immigrant groups will be afraid to respond out of fear about their immigration status. In September, census researchers reported they were already seeing an unprecedented amount of concern about the confidentiality of census responses amid the Trump administration’s harsh immigration rhetoric and policies.The census already asks Americans about their citizenship as part of the American Community Survey, a smaller annual survey that goes out to about 3 million people. The Department of Justice asked the Commerce Department to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, saying it needed better information to better enforce Section 2 the Voting Rights Act, the landmark 1965 law designed to protect the voting power of minorities. Section 2 prohibits discriminatory voting practices. The census has not asked about citizenship on the decennial form since 1950, and former top Justice Department officials say that the ACS provides adequate data to enforce the law.On Tuesday, Schneiderman questioned whether U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions was really interested in better enforcing the Voting Rights Act.“Jeff Sessions has not brought one case under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act since he’s been Attorney General,” he said.A Commerce Department spokesman expressed confidence that the decision to add the citizenship question would withstand legal scrutiny.“We are not going to comment on the specifics of pending litigation, but these cases are without merit. We look forward to prevailing in court and continuing to work with the Census Bureau to conduct a complete and accurate 2020 census,” the spokesman said.This post has been updated."

I married someone the first time who completely changed.”“The person I ended up with was not the person I originally met,” she went on. “And that wasn’t my fault ― that was his. I knew how much I had to give and how much I wanted to receive.”Cuoco and Sweeting met in 2013. The two got engaged in September of that year, just three months after they were first spotted together. They married a few months later in a whirlwind ceremony on New Year’s Eve.However, after 21 months of marriage, Cuoco filed for divorce in 2015. The 32-year-old confessed the two just weren’t a match shortly after the split.“I knew even deep down, I know this is just not the right thing. The right thing is coming for me, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it,” she said during an appearance on “The Talk” in 2016.“I think even when I went through my big breakup, even my friends that know me so well, I might have said things like, ‘I’m never going to love again. I’m never going to get married again,’” she said at the time. “But the people that know you best, they know my heart and that’s just not me.”Sweeting himself has said little publicly about the divorce.After splitting from Sweeting, Cuoco began dating professional equestrian Karl Cook in April 2016. The two got engaged this past November. The “Big Bang Theory” star told Cosmo she can’t wait to marry her new fiancé. “I knew I just had to be patient,” she told the magazine. “I had to go through a lot of things, but it brought me to Karl.” Head to Cosmopolitan to read the rest of Cuoco’s interview or look for it on newsstands April 10. Video: Kaley Cuoco Recreates Penny's Most Iconic Scenes From 'The Big Bang Theory'This article originally appeared on HuffPost."
b'Crash Tests Show Some Small-SUV Passengers Less Safe than Drivers',https://www.yahoo.com/news/crash-tests-show-small-suv-passengers-less-safe-040102342.html,"Consumer Reports has no financial relationship with advertisers on this site.Consumer Reports has no financial relationship with advertisers on this site.New crash test results show that some popular vehicles still don’t offer adequate protection for passengers even if they can keep drivers safe in certain types of crashes.On Wednesday, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) released passenger-side small overlap test scores for seven small SUVs. The 40 mph test mimics a crash where the front corner of the vehicle collides with a tree, telephone pole, or the front corner of another vehicle.The Ford Escape earned the lowest possible rating of “Poor” for a passenger-side impact, which translates to a “very high likelihood of the passenger having a thigh or hip injury,” according to IIHS. The Mitsubishi Outlander Sport earned a Marginal rating for the passenger. However, both vehicles earned “Acceptable” scores for crash tests on the driver’s side.IIHS says this is because some vehicles were designed only to pass the group’s driver-side small overlap tests. For instance, Ford reinforced the structure of the driver’s side on the Escape starting in 2017, but did not make the same changes on the passenger side. “They already have the know-how for what to do to improve structure,” said Becky Muller, lead engineer for IIHS’ small overlap tests. “To apply the same kinds of designs to the passenger side would be the simplest and most effective fix.”The results echo those found in prior tests, where the current Subaru Forester and Toyota RAV4 both scored better on driver-side tests than on passenger-side tests. Both of those vehicles will be redesigned for 2019. A spokesman from Toyota told CR, ""The 2019 RAV4 that we revealed at last week’s New York International Auto Show is on our new TNGA platform, and we’ve incorporated countermeasures to meet or exceed tests.""Mueller said that most automakers are reacting to the new test by making safety improvements when a model is scheduled to be refreshed or redesigned. “Since we announced the official rating test, we’ve seen a dramatic increase in the number of 'Good' rated vehicles that we’re testing on the passenger side,” she said.""These results also demonstrate the value of third-party testing,"" said Jen Stockburger, director of operations at CR's auto test center. ""Ratings are not only a useful tool for consumers, but can drive industry to make important improvements.""According to IIHS, side-curtain airbags did not deploy during tests of both the Outlander Sport and the Escape, which may have been a factor in both vehicles’ scores.“If these vehicles aren’t designed specifically with the passenger small overlap test in mind, the restraint systems may not be tuned to deploy when they need to in a crash,” Mueller said. The BMW X1, Chevrolet Equinox, GMC Terrain, Jeep Compass, and Mitsubishi Outlander joined the previously tested Hyundai Tucson, Honda CR-V, Kia Sportage, and Mazda CX-5 and CX-3 to earn top “Good” ratings for passenger-side small overlap crash tests. The agency, which is supported by auto insurers, has evaluated a total of 16 small SUVs and 13 midsize sedans.“When there is a passenger in a car, we believe they deserve the same level of protection in a small overlap crash as would the driver,” said Mueller. “The people who are typically sitting in that right front passenger seat are your loved ones.” GoodGoodMarginalGoodGoodPoorConsumer Reports is an independent, nonprofit organization that works side by side with consumers to create a fairer, safer, and healthier world.

b'Fiji PM warns of &apos;frightening new era&apos; as he blames deadly cyclone on climate change',https://www.yahoo.com/news/fiji-pm-warns-apos-frightening-142646895.html," Fiji’s prime minister has blamed climate change for a cyclone which killed five people and caused severe flooding,  saying the Pacific nation is now under constant threat and has entered a “frightening new era”.As authorities tried to restore power and water supplies across various islands, Frank Bainimarama said Fiji was facing a “fight for our very survival” and urged other countries to support efforts to tackle the causes of climate change. ""We are now at an almost constant level of threat from these extreme weather events that are becoming more frequent and more severe because of climate change,"" he said.""As a nation we are starting to build our resilience in response to the frightening new era that is upon us.""Cyclone Josie brought torrential rains and led to heavy flooding on the weekend. It came just six weeks after Cyclone Gita in February, which caused some property damage in Fiji but devastated Tonga, and two years after Cyclone Winston, which killed 44 people.Fiji and other small Pacific nations have led a desperate push for global action to combat climate change, saying that rising sea levels and intense weather events have already begun to make parts of their territory uninhabitable.Mr Bainimarama assumed a leading role in international climate talks last November when he served as president of the UN's COP23 negotiation in Bonn.""We need to get the message out loud and clear to the entire world about the absolute need to confront this crisis head on,"" he said.Most scientists believe climate change will reduce the frequency of cyclones as temperature differences between the earth’s surface and the atmosphere decrease. But it will lead to more intense cyclones – including higher wind speeds and greater rainfall  - as warmer water temperatures add to overall precipitation and to the amount of energy at the water surface. Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology said it was difficult to detect trends about cyclone intensity in the region because of a lack of consistent data. But it noted: “We may have fewer cyclones but the ones we do have will be stronger.”Five places | threatened by climate changeProfessor James Renwick, an expert in atmospheric sciences at Victoria University of Wellington, told Radio New Zealand in February he expected cyclone intensity to increase because there will be “more energy in the climate system”. “Warmer seas, warmer air - so when you have a tropical cyclone it's likely to be more intense,"" he said.Since the latest cyclone in Fiji, authorities have been clearing  debris, restoring roads and assisting people who have taken shelter in dozens of evacuation centres.Ranjana Devi, a mother of two, said her family was trapped in their house as the floodwaters smashed through their village  and started rising in their home. She and her husband were in separate rooms – each with a son - and survived when their  boys kicked through a window and opened a door to allow them to escape.“At one point it was me and my younger son Veron trapped in one room,” she told the Fiji Sun.“My husband and elder son Devan were trapped in the other room. It all happened so quickly. As the water rose, we knew we could have all died and what made it worse was the fact that we were separated and locked in different rooms.”She added: “From here, we will rebuild and start all over. We have lost everything in this flood.”"

"b'China to hit US soybeans, cars, planes with retaliatory tariffs'",https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-hit-us-soybeans-cars-planes-retaliatory-tariffs-094327231.html,"China Wednesday announced plans to hit the United States with new tariffs of 25 percent on soybeans, aircraft, cars and other imports worth $50 billion, hours after Washington unveiled its own target list.China's commerce ministry listed 106 products to be targeted and said a date for the implementation of the tariffs would be announced separately.The new tariffs mark a significant escalation of the brewing trade war between the world's two largest economies -- with the $100 billion worth of goods cumulatively targeted representing about 17 percent of the $580 billion in two-way trade last year.A third of US soybean exports go to China, totalling $14 billion last year, and the product comes from rural states that voted for President Donald Trump in the 2016 election.As the Trump administration has ramped up trade actions against China, policymakers in Beijing have emphasised they do not want a trade war but will not back down in the face of US pressure.""Any attempt to bring China to its knees through threats and intimidation will never succeed. It will not succeed this time either,"" foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular news briefing on Wednesday.""There is no winner in a trade war, and an initiator will harm itself as well as others,"" Geng said, noting China had referred the latest US action to the World Trade Organization.In recent weeks, both sides have said they are continuing to negotiate -- something which could avert the eventual implementation of the tariffs."
b'Betsy DeVos Mulls The Fate Of Guidance Designed To Reduce Racial Bias In Schools',https://www.yahoo.com/news/betsy-devos-mulls-fate-guidance-173321065.html,"Education Secretary Betsy DeVos met with a group of civil rights leaders, parents and teachers Wednesday morning to discuss the impact of Obama-era guidance that calls on schools to reduce their reliance on suspensions and to consider whether racial bias plays a role in their disciplinary practices. The examination of this guidance is part of DeVos’ work as leader of a new Federal Commission on School Safety, although she has reportedly been thinking for months about rescinding the guidance.Wednesday’s meeting, which took place on the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., involved leaders in some of the country’s most prominent civil rights groups, including the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and the Lawyer’s Committee for Civil Rights Under Law ― all of which are strongly in favor of keeping the guidance. Other participants included leaders from the nation’s largest teachers union, the National Education Association, as well as teachers from the advocacy group Educators for Excellence and education researchers.Later on Wednesday, DeVos also met with groups, parents and teachers who want to see the guidance repealed.Liz King, senior policy analyst and director of education policy for the Leadership Conference, described the morning meeting as “frustrating and underwhelming.” King spoke directly to Education Department officials about how this administration’s actions are having a negative impact on school climate, especially for LGBTQ and immigrant students. She urged DeVos to maintain the existing guidance.“Our children deserve better than this administration,” said King, who described DeVos as “very pleasant,” although “she didn’t say much.”Evan Stone, co-CEO of Educators for Excellence, left the meeting with a more positive view, although he still suspects advocates of the guidance are fighting an “uphill battle.” He was heartened that DeVos opened the meeting by acknowledging the large racial disparities in how students are disciplined. DeVos said she was moved by the stories from educators in the room, according to Stone.Stone’s group requested that DeVos come visit some of the communities that have had positive experiences with the Obama-era guidance.“Hopefully the lived experience of teachers who are working to change things will have an impact,” he said. In a country where students of color, students with disabilities and LGBTQ students are disproportionately subject to harsh disciplinary practices, like suspensions and expulsions, the guidance is seen as a tool to help reduce the flow of students who are pushed from school into the criminal justice system. The guidance warns schools that they could be found in violation of federal civil rights laws if they are disciplining some groups of students ― like students of color or students with disabilities ― at disproportionately high rates. It also encourages schools to adopt restorative justice practices as a way to deal with discipline issues, rather than punishments that push kids out of the classroom.On the other side of the issue, critics say the guidance helps keep disruptive children in the classroom, putting teachers and students at risk. The guidance came under renewed scrutiny after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, in February, when conservative leaders speculated that lax discipline policies allowed the accused shooter’s behavior to go unchecked. (The school’s responses to the suspect’s behavior appear entirely unrelated to the guidance. The Education Department had also started meeting with critics of the guidance months before the shooting.)But even before Wednesday’s meetings began, DeVos faced critiques from the advocacy groups and civil rights organizations that had not been offered a seat at the table. Groups like the National Women’s Law Center sent DeVos a letter slamming what they called “the exclusive and non-transparent approach” of the summit. The letter was co-signed by groups like the Human Rights Campaign and the National Center for Transgender Equality. It expressed the groups’ support for the guidance.  A number of other groups asked to be included in Wednesday’s discussion but did not receive an invitation. A representative from the National Disability Rights Network told HuffPost they asked the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights for an invitation last Friday, but the agency declined. The Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates, a group that represents children with disabilities, also asked both the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights and its Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services for an invitation, but did not hear back.King said it was “was glaringly apparent there was no one from the disability community, the LGBTQ community, the Native American community, the Latino community, or the immigrant community in the room.”Additionally, only one of the country’s major teachers unions was invited, with the administration leaving out the American Federation of Teachers.“I find it very offensive that they don’t want to hear our opinions,” AFT President Randi Weingarten told HuffPost.DeVos’ meeting with critics of the guidance included groups like the Manhattan Institute, as well as parents and teachers who believe the guidance should be rescinded. (The Education Department did not respond to HuffPost’s request for information about who would be present at this meeting.)Nicole Landers of Baltimore County is one such parent. She says the relaxed disciplinary practices at her kids’ schools have come at the expense of student safety. Landers’ daughter was sexually harassed last year by another student when she was a fifth-grader. Her older son was bullied to the point where he became suicidal. Their tormentors, though, remained in the classroom, and she believes the Obama-era guidance helped make this situation possible.“Whatever intentions were set forth in the guidance, the response to the guidance has been kind of knee-jerk in nature that has ended up hurting all of the children,” Landers said. “It takes away the rights from the victimized students, as the offending students are left in the classroom to avoid suspensions.”This is a developing story.

All were from Bristol.Police said the family were driving back to their rental home when the “heavy-duty pick-up truck violently impacted the passenger side of the small sedan”.Titusville Police Department deputy chief Todd Hutchinson said: “Our emergency personnel were on the scene within a few minutes. There was nothing they could do; all four were pronounced deceased at the scene.”A fifth member of the family, a son of Brian and Sheralyn, was also on the holiday but not in the car at the time.“He lost his brother, his sister-in-law and his mum and dad,” Mr Hutchinson said. “Very, very tragic. He was doing the notifications last night to other family members over in England.“That was a very tough notification. It was tough for all involved. The job of first responders is to sustain life and to help people at scenes. They were very frustrated because there was nothing they could do for these four that died fairly instantly from the violent collision.”The family were staying in Davenport, south-east of Orlando – a popular holiday destination among Brits.Police said the sat-nav they were using showed they were travelling back to their holiday home when they were were re-routed due to another collision and turned into the path of the oncoming truck.“The GPS had indicated for them to make a U-turn at that intersection which was an illegal U-turn unfortunately and violated the right of way of the pick-up truck,” Mr Hutchinson said.There was heavy traffic in the area due to a SpaceX rocket launch at Cape Canaveral. It is not clear whether the Stephenson family had been to watch the launch before the crash that killed them..The 28-year-old driver of the pick-up truck was taken to hospital with “non life-threatening injuries”, police said.A UK Foreign Office spokesman said: “We are supporting the family of four British people who have died in Florida.

"b'Africa Is Splitting in Two, and Here&apos;s the Proof'",https://www.yahoo.com/news/africa-splitting-two-apos-proof-201200527.html,"A piece of East Africa is expected to break off the main continent in tens of millions of years. And if you need any proof, look no further than Kenya's Rift Valley, where a giant, gaping tear opened up following heavy rains and seismic activity, according to Face2Face Africa.The enormous crack appeared on March 19 and measures more than 50 feet (15 meters) wide and several miles along, Face2Face Africa and other news sources reported. Moreover, it's still growing longer. The rift is likely a sign of things to come as the plate tectonics under Africa rearrange themselves. The majority of Africa sits on top of the African Plate. However, a long, vertical piece of eastern Africa lies on top of the Somali Plate. This juncture where the two plates meet is known as the East African Rift, which stretches an astonishing 1,800 miles (3,000 kilometers), or about the distance from Denver to Boston. [50 Interesting Facts About Planet Earth]To avoid confusion (given that Africa doesn't sit on only one plate), researchers call the giant African plate the Nubian Plate. In essence, the Nubian and Somali plates are being split in two, according to a piece in The Conversation by Lucia Perez Diaz, a postdoctoral researcher at the Fault Dynamics Research Group at Royal Holloway, University of London.Here's how two plates split apart: The lithosphere, which is broken up into tectonic plates, is made of the Earth's crust and the upper part of the mantle. When the lithosphere experiences tugging forces, it becomes thinner, until it eventually ruptures, Perez Diaz wrote. This rupture has already led to the formation of the rift valley.The rupture process is often accompanied by seismic activity and volcanism. In the East African Rift's case, a large mantle plume under the lithosphere is weakening it, allowing it to stretch, Perez Diaz said.Rifts lead to recognizable land formations — that is, a series of depressions surrounded by higher ground. The East African Rift has a series of rift valleys that can be seen from space. However, not all of these rifts formed at the same time. Rather, they started in northern Ethiopia about 30 million years ago and spread southward toward Zimbabwe at an average rate of between 1 and 2 inches (2.5 and 5 centimeters) a year, Perez Diaz said.As the Somali and Nubian plates move apart, the region can experience earthquakes, as it did in southwestern Kenya last week. The giant crack tore the busy Mai Mahiu-Narok road in two and split apart houses, including the home of a 72-year-old woman who was eating dinner with her family when it happened, according to Face2Face Africa.Original article on Live Science."

"b'Former U.S. Army Sniper, 2 Other Soldiers Accused of Becoming International Hitmen'",https://www.yahoo.com/news/former-u-army-sniper-2-144836866.html,"(NEW YORK) — A former U.S. Army sniper and two other ex-American soldiers agreed to become contract killers for an international crime boss who wanted to settle a score with a real estate agent in the Philippines he thought had cheated him on a land deal, a prosecutor said Tuesday in opening statements at the trial of the three men.Joseph Hunter, a onetime sergeant with a Special Forces background, Adam Samia and Carl David Stillwell have denied they planned the 2012 execution-style hit — a case that’s provided an inside glimpse into the secret fraternity of private mercenaries willing to kill in cold blood for cash.Prosecutors said the 52-year-old Hunter was working as a security chief for weapons and drug trafficker Paul Le Roux when he recruited Samia and Stillwell to travel from their homes in Roxboro, North Carolina, to the Philippines for what was called “ninja work.” Hunter provided firearms and silencers and told them Le Roux would pay them $35,000 a piece to get the job done, Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Egan said in federal court in Manhattan.The broker, Catherine Lee, was on a “kill list” that self-styled assassins with military backgrounds saw as a golden opportunity, Egan said.“If Paul Le Roux wanted somebody killed, these guys got the call,” he said. “For these men, more murders meant more money.”Samia, 43, and Stillwell, 50, did surveillance on Lee before contacting her pretending to be potential clients, the prosecutor said. While returning from a trip to the countryside outside of Manila, Samia pulled out a .22-caliber gun and killed Lee by shooting her twice in the face as she sat in the back seat of a van, he said.Lee’s body was found on a pile of garbage on the side of the road, Egan said. After being paid, her killers were ordered back to the United States, where they were arrested in 2015.An investigation turned up a picture on Stillwell’s phone of a bloody head wrapped in a towel that was taken around the time of Lee’s death, authorities said. He also admitted being behind the wheel of the van when she was shot, they added.Prosecutors said other evidence includes a secretly recorded video of Hunter from a sting in Thailand that resulted in a separate conviction for plotting to kill a Drug Enforcement Administration agent. They said he’s overheard talking about killing people for Le Roux, including a Filipino real-estate agent.On Tuesday, defense attorneys asked jurors to keep an open mind, saying the case lacked eyewitness, forensic and other conclusive evidence needed to convict. They also told them not to trust shady government witnesses like Le Roux, who has pleaded guilty and is cooperating.Hunter’s attorney, Cesar De Castro, suggested the government couldn’t prove its case.Samia only agreed “to do legitimate, legal security work,” said his lawyer, Jeremy Schneider. Stillman’s lawyer, Robert Ray, didn’t deny his client’s statements about being in the van but claimed he never joined a murder conspiracy.“It just didn’t happen,” Ray said."
b'Afghan Air Force in the spotlight after madrassa bombing',https://www.yahoo.com/news/afghan-air-force-spotlight-madrassa-bombing-133618310.html,"Kabul (AFP) - A deadly airstrike on a religious school in Afghanistan has turned the spotlight on the country's fledgling air force, which is increasingly taking on combat missions to pressure insurgents.Dozens of children were killed or wounded when Afghan Air Force (AAF) helicopters attacked the madrassa in the northeastern province of Kunduz, Afghan security sources told AFP. The defence ministry has distanced the AAF from the civilian casualties, but the United Nations has launched an investigation.AFP explains Afghanistan's air capability, its previous mishaps and who is training them.- Who flies the planes? -Afghanistan's air force was decimated by the civil war of the 1990s and the turbulent period of Taliban rule that ended in 2001.Western forces began rebuilding it in 2007 but it has been a slow process.NATO's Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan has been training pilots and ground controllers across the country as part of a modernisation of the AAF.Getting selected is not easy. Each recruit is subject to intensive background checks by Afghan intelligence, and must also be sponsored by two officers to attest they have no links to the enemy.- What aircraft do they have? -Precise figures on the size of Afghanistan's fleet and the number of pilots are not available.But US Forces' officials told AFP in February that it includes four C-130 transport aircraft, 24 C-208 supply planes, 24 Russian Mi-17 helicopters that will be replaced by 159 UH-60 Black Hawks, 12 A-29 Super Tacano attack planes, and 25 MD-530 attack helicopters.At the same time, the US -- the only foreign force known to be carrying out airstrikes in the country -- is deploying more aircraft to Afghanistan, which has become the main theatre of operations for the US Air Force following a drawdown in Syria and Iraq.- When did they start bombing? -AAF airstrikes are relatively recent -- the airforce only dropped its first bomb about a year ago, though its ability to support ground troops and carry out surveillance is growing.It has accelerated bombardments in recent months as the Americans beef up the country's aerial capability with more aircraft and better weapons.Last month, the AAF dropped its first laser-guided bomb on a Taliban compound in the western province of Farah, where the militants have gone on the offensive.The US has also ramped up airstrikes as part of US President Donald Trump's new strategy for Afghanistan that has given American forces more leeway to go after the Taliban and other militant groups.- How accurate are they? -Without access to full figures on Afghan airstrikes it is difficult to say with any certainty, but mistakes are being made.In 2017, the United Nations noted in its annual report on civilian casualties that more Afghans were being killed in airstrikes -- a rise of seven percent over the previous year, the highest number of casualties since the UN began recording such figures in 2009.Of the total 295 deaths and 336 injured documented by the UN in aerial operations, the AAF was responsible for 99 deaths and 210 injured.In October an ""erroneous"" Afghan airstrike killed 10 security forces in volatile Helmand province; while in August the country's air force killed up to 13 civilians in airstrikes targeting a Taliban base in the western province of Herat."

b'Jenna Dewan Tatum Hinted At Marital Trouble With Channing Tatum Months Ago',https://www.yahoo.com/news/jenna-dewan-tatum-hinted-marital-163307361.html,"Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan Tatum’s announcement that they were splitting after nearly nine years of marriage left fans everywhere feeling blindsided. But looking back, there may have been hints of marital trouble over the past few months. In an interview with Health magazine in February, Dewan Tatum revealed their marriage wasn’t perfect.“When people say you guys have such a perfect life, I want to scream and tell them no one’s perfect,” she said. “I think there are such things as great fits. It is a great fit as long as you are growing together, and I think up until this point we’ve really grown together. Even if one starts to grow, the other catches up and vice versa.” She added: “We’ve always had the same values. But we’re not perfect! Are you kidding? We fight like other couples, we disagree about things, we have days where we don’t really like each other.Someoutlets also pointed out that Dewan Tatum stepped out without Tatum at the Vanity Fair Oscars after party, and instead brought along her girlfriend, actress Emmanuelle Chriqui. Dewan Tatum insisted that Channing was “so happy to have a night off.”People pointed out that the couple, who generally gush over each other on social media, have been relatively mum the past few months. Instead, Dewan Tatum posted what some now see as “cryptic Instagrams:”After meeting on the set of “Step Up” in 2006, the two married in Malibu, California, in 2009 and welcomed their only child, Everly, in 2013.The couple said they remain devoted to their 4-year-old in a statement they released about their split on Monday. “We have lovingly chosen to separate as a couple. We fell deeply in love so many years ago and have had a magical journey together,” the statement said.“Absolutely nothing has changed about how much we love one another, but love is a beautiful adventure that is taking us on different paths for now,” it continued. “There are no secrets nor salacious events at the root of our decision — just two best-friends realizing it’s time to take some space and help each other live the most joyous, fulfilled lives as possible.”Related Video: "

Moscow signed a deal with Beijing to sell China the potent weapon system in 2014.""Two vessels have delivered the first regimental set of S-400s from the port of Ust-Lug, Leningrad Region, to China within the time limit established by the contract. It includes a command post, radar stations, launching stations, energy equipment and other property. It lacks the equipment that was onboard the third vessel,"" a Russian defense source told the TASS news agency. ""The work continues, and the missing equipment is expected to be delivered to the customer in the summer.""Recommended: We Went Aboard the Most Powerful Aircraft Carrier Ever Built.Recommended: This Is How China Would Invade Taiwan (And How to Stop It).Recommended: The Story of the F-52 Fighter.A third vessel carrying additional hardware was caught in a storm enroute from Russia and had to turn back. It appears that the weapon system will not operable until the missing hardware is delivered.Meanwhile, Russia is pressing ahead to deliver the S-400 to Turkey by 2020. Ankara seems to be pressing ahead to buy the Russian-made weapons despite strong opposition from its NATO ally, the United States.""A priority task in the sphere of military technical cooperation is the implementation of the contract for supplies of S-400 Triumf missile systems to Turkey,"" Russian president Vladimir Putin said during of the Russia-Turkey Cooperation Council according to TASS. ""We hope that the sectoral intergovernmental commission will look into the prospects for further supplies of Russian-made military hardware to Turkey at its next meeting.”Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov told TASS that Moscow would do everything possible to deliver the S-400 to Turkey—which has already made a down payment—by 2020. ""Turkey did raise this issue. As far as I know, steps will be taken to meet Turkey’s wish,"" Ushakov said.Turkey, for its part, is determined to buy the S-400 despite the threat of sanctions by the United States.“The U.S. understands Turkey’s desire to improve its air defenses,” a Trump administration official told the Hürriyet Daily News. “But we are concerned and have said so publicly about potential acquisition of Russian S-400 missiles, which would have implications for NATO interoperability and which would potentially expose Turkey to sanctions due to the new sanctions law recently passed by Congress.”Turkey points out that NATO allies did not pressure Greece to drop its S-300 purchase in previous year, though that deal came under during a much less antagonistic period in the West’s relations with Russia.“You’ve said nothing to Greece but you said that you will not let Turkey acquire S-400,” Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan said according to the Moscow-based TASS news agency. “You claimed that the contact with Russia was a mistake. You also said that you might introduce sanctions. We are not going to be accountable to you. We will proceed along the right way without any concessions for the sake of achieving our own goals.”As with many other nations, the Turks are concerned by the U.S. Congress’ infringement on their sovereignty. More often than not, Congress passes laws where the lawmakers—who often maintain a well-educated but very inexperienced staff—fail to consider the second and third order consequences of their actions.  Dave Majumdar is the defense editor for The National Interest.

b'Marco Rubio on gun control: It depends who he&#39;s talking to',https://www.yahoo.com/news/dc-officials-cite-gun-control-hypocrisy-condemning-rubio-041839636.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) — It was one week after the fatal shootings at a Parkland, Florida, high school, and Republican Sen. Marco Rubio was looking to show solidarity with an angry crowd of parents and students in his home state. He told them — and a national television audience — that 18-year-olds should not be able to buy a rifle and said, ""I will support a law that takes that right away.""About 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) north, District of Columbia officials could only shake their heads in disbelief. The city already had a law barring 18-year-olds from buying rifles, yet Rubio was the main senator pushing legislation to end that ban, as well as D.C.'s prohibition of assault weapons.""Rubio's gun bill should be a public embarrassment as well as a personal embarrassment to him,"" said Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington's nonvoting delegate in Congress.Gun control has long been a sore point in relations between officials in this heavily Democratic city, home to some of the nation's toughest gun control laws, and Republicans, who as the congressional majority have power over D.C.'s laws. The strong feelings have intensified with the nation at a crossroads moment in the gun control debate after the Feb. 14 shootings at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and a subsequent ""March for Our Lives"" gun-control rally in Washington.Rubio, in particular, is seen as the villain. City officials accuse him of playing cynical political games with the lives of Washington residents to curry favor with the National Rifle Association.Following the town hall, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser challenged Rubio to withdraw his bill. Rubio sent her a letter saying that he and Bowser ""share a common goal"" and that his bill seeks only to bring Washington ""in line with federal law."" If federal law changes —which Rubio said is his goal — then Washington's laws would change as well.Bowser, a Democrat, posted the letter on Twitter with her handwritten notes and objections written in the margins. Those notes include Bowser calling Rubio's stance ""the epitome of hypocrisy.""""He's just using it to boost his NRA score,"" Bowser said in an interview with The Associated Press. ""What we think Marco Rubio should be focused on is his job.""Asked for comment by The Associated Press, Rubio staffers responded by providing the Rubio letter that Bowser had posted.Rubio introduced the bill, known as the Second Amendment Enforcement Act, in 2015 and again in 2017. According to the NRA website, Rubio has an A-plus rating. Among its list of Rubio accomplishments is that he ""sponsored legislation that would repeal Washington, D.C.'s draconian gun control laws and restore the right of self-defense to law-abiding individuals in our nation's capital.""Norton said she's been fighting off similar bills in Congress for years. Another one, sponsored by Virginia Republican Tom Garrett, exists in the House. Neither of them has much chance of passing because the Republican majorities in Congress wouldn't hold together on such a divisive issue, she said.""The worst part is why he did it. Why would a senator from Florida take on this issue?"" Norton asked. ""He's coming back every year for his NRA payoff.""According to public records, Rubio received just under $10,000 directly from the NRA during the 2016 election. However the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which combines direct contributions from the NRA with contributions from like-minded affiliates, super PACs and money spent on campaign ads on behalf of the candidate, estimates that Rubio has received more than $3.3 million over the course of his career, making him the 6th-highest recipient in Congress.The Washington government has bristled for years under what officials call the heavy-handed and arrogant oversight of Congress, which has the right to alter or spike all Washington laws.Washington has long fought to defend its strict gun control. A 2008 Supreme Court ruling declared Washington's blanket ban on handgun ownership unconstitutional. Washington restrictions such as preventing gun owners from registering more than one gun per month and requiring re-registration every three years also have been struck down by the courts.The issues of Washington's autonomy and its gun control laws are deeply intertwined. The closest Washington has come in recent years to having a vote in Congress unraveled over gun control.Republicans have opposed statehood for the District of Columbia, which would boost Democratic power in Congress. Despite the Republican Party's general opposition to federal interference in state issues, the official GOP platform stance on D.C. statehood is that it can only be achieved via constitutional amendment. The platform states that ""the nation's capital city is a special responsibility of the federal government because it belongs both to its residents and to all Americans.""A 2009 compromise proposed creating a new congressional district in heavily Republican Utah. In exchange, Washington's House delegate seat would be upgraded to full voting status.However, as the D.C. Voting Rights Act worked its way through Congress, Republican Nevada Sen. John Ensign attached a rider that would have required Washington to abolish most of its gun-ownership restrictions. The city government concluded it was too high a price to pay and the bill was shelved."

b'1 Elephant Died and 4 Others Were Hurt After a Circus Truck Crash',https://www.yahoo.com/news/1-elephant-died-4-others-142345297.html,"(MADRID) — An elephant died and four more are being treated for injuries after a circus truck accident on a major Spanish highway that provoked an outcry among animal rights defenders.The truck overturned on Monday on the highway linking Albacete with Murcia, in the south of the country, after overtaking another long vehicle, said Albacete’s Civil Guard spokesman Jose Amado.He said the initial investigation has found that the movement of the five female elephants inside the truck could have destabilized it when the driver maneuvered to switch lanes.The driver wasn’t injured, the spokesman said, but one of the elephants died on the spot.The four surviving elephants are being treated by veterinarians in a public facility before being moved to a clinic in coming days, Amado said. Three of them have minor cuts and one has more serious injuries to her legs.“With five unpredictable animals, each one of them weighing three to four tons, accidents can happen no matter how much care has been taken,” he said.Photos and videos shared by local police and authorities showed the elephants standing on the road and being lifted onto trucks by huge industrial cranes.A section of the highway near Pozo Canada, south of Albacete, remained closed for nearly three hours until the carcass of the dead elephant was also removed, local authorities said.Animal rights groups said the accident is the latest example of how the nature of the circus business is a danger to the physical and behavioral needs of wild animals.“These incredible animals are being carted around the country, confined and forced to perform,” said Animal Defenders International President Jan Creamer in an emailed statement, adding that animals are often “confined in small spaces, deprived of physical and social needs, spending excessive amounts of time shut in transporters.”The Association of United Circuses said the overturned truck had been cleared by authorities for the transportation of animals and the journey had been approved by veterinarians.“Animal rights activists have turned this accident into a scandal,” said the association’s spokesman, Ignacio Pedrera. “They have used it to make politics and attack this industry when road accidents, whether involving animals or not, happen all the time.”Pedrera said 13 out of the 22 active circuses touring Spain use animals in performances. The industry employs more than 2,500 families, he added."

There are always skirmishes at night,"" Kurdish fighter Shiyar Kobane said. ""They fire mortar rounds and shell our positions.""At a US military base near the city, three armoured cars bearing the US flag were driving back to camp after completing a mission.- US base between olive trees -A helicopter flew overhead after taking off in a swirl of dust from the base, fortified with mounds of rubble between olive trees.Coalition forces carry out regular patrols on the frontline and ""have increased their patrolling tours recently"", SDF commander Khalil Mustafa told AFP.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitor with sources on the ground, says around 350 members of the US-led coalition -- mostly American troops -- are stationed around Manbij.Military sources on the ground, the Observatory and pro-regime newspaper Al-Watan say the coalition has sent in reinforcements, heavy artillery and other military equipment to the area.An AFP correspondent saw the US troops even after President Donald Trump said Thursday that he would pull forces out of Syria ""very soon"".Trump was speaking the same day that two members of the coalition -- an American and a Briton -- were killed by an improvised explosive device in Manbij.Since 2014, the coalition has provided weapons, training and other support to forces fighting IS jihadists in Syria and neighbouring Iraq.Turkey-led forces last month seized control of the Kurdish enclave of Afrin to the west of Manbij after a two-month assault that killed dozens of civilians and displaced tens of thousands of civilians.- 'Taking threats seriously' -Ankara views the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) militia that controlled Afrin as ""terrorists"", although the YPG formed the backbone of the US-backed SDF that has ousted IS from much of Syria.Erdogan has warned that Turkey could extend the Afrin offensive to Manbij.Trenches have been dug outside the city and checkpoints erected to thoroughly scan the identity papers of those entering the city.""We're taking the Turkish threats seriously,"" Mohammed Abu Adel, the head of the Manbij Military Council -- a part of the SDF -- told AFP.""The international coalition has increased the number of its forces in Manbij,"" he said.Abdelkarim Omar, a top foreign affairs official with the Kurdish semi-autonomous administration in northern Syria, said US forces were not likely to leave the country any time soon.""It's premature to speak of any American withdrawal,"" he said.""Terrorism is still present,"" he added, referring to IS fighters.Two offensives -- one by the SDF and another by the regime -- have expelled the jihadists from much of Syria.But IS fighters still cling to pockets of territory in eastern Syria and maintain the ability to launch deadly attacks.They carried out a spate of attacks that killed 19 pro-government fighters last week in eastern Syria, and in March seized a district of the capital."
b'APNewsBreak: Woman says she reported abuse in 2013',https://www.yahoo.com/news/possible-sighting-mother-deadly-suv-crash-175903298.html,"SEATTLE (AP) — A woman said Tuesday that she told Oregon child welfare officials in 2013 that Jennifer and Sarah Hart — who plunged off a California cliff with their children last month in an SUV — had been depriving the kids of food as punishment.In a statement provided to The Associated Press, Alexandra Argyropoulos, a former friend of the Harts, said she ""witnessed what I felt to be controlling emotional abuse and cruel punishment"" toward the six children.Argyropoulos said she was told after she made the report that Oregon officials had interviewed the children but it was apparent that each child had been coached by their mothers on what to say. She said she was told there was nothing more the Oregon Department of Human Services could do because there was not enough evidence to make a case.""My heart is completely broken. The current system failed to protect these children from their abusers,"" Argyropoulos said.Authorities have said social services officials in Oregon contacted the West Linn Police Department about the family in 2013 while they were living in the area. Police referred media questions to the Oregon Department of Human Services, which cited privacy laws in refusing to say whether the agency was involved.Authorities don't know exactly when the wreck took place. A passing motorist discovered the vehicle on March 26, three days after social service authorities in Washington state opened an investigation apparently prompted by a neighbor's complaint that the children were being deprived of food.The Hart family's two moms and three of the six adopted children were found dead; the three others are missing and presumed dead, possibly washed out to sea.Authorities are investigating whether a surveillance video from Fort Bragg, California, shows one of the women a day before the SUV was found. California Highway Patrol investigators are working with the FBI to try to enhance the video.Later Tuesday, the highway patrol said investigators believe the Hart family was in or around Newport, Oregon, at about 8:15 a.m. March 24 and that they continued traveling south until reaching the area of Fort Bragg, California that evening. The family stayed in that area until the next evening, the state patrol said, officials said.The SUV carrying the family plummeted 100 feet (31 meters) from a highway near Mendocino, California.On Sunday, authorities disclosed that data from the vehicle's software suggested the crash was deliberate. They said the SUV had stopped at a pull-off area before speeding straight off the cliff.Sarah Hart pleaded guilty in 2011 to a domestic assault charge in Minnesota over what she said was a spanking given to one of her children.Argyropoulos said she was unaware of a 2011 domestic assault conviction against Sarah Hart. She said she had met the couple on Facebook, knew them for about eight months and that the family visited her in the Bay Area twice. The couple broke off contact with her after she voiced concerns to them about their treatment of the children, she said.Two weeks ago, Bruce and Dana DeKalb, next-door neighbors of the Harts in Woodland, Washington, called state Child Protective Services because the couple's 15-year-old son Devonte had been coming over to their house almost every day for a week, asking for food.Dana DeKalb said Devonte told her his parents were ""punishing them by withholding food."" The boy asked her to leave food in a box by the fence for him, she said.Devonte, a black boy who is still missing, drew national attention after he was photographed in tears while hugging a white police officer during a 2014 protest."

On top of a steadily declining customer base, the announcement of the Kansas City plant closure, and the president’s recent metal tariffs, the MoCo has just issued a massive recall of roughly 250,000 motorcycles worldwide on account of a brake problem that can supposedly result in sudden failure. The recall affects the ABS on 2008 to 2011 model year Touring, CVO Touring, and VRSC machines. Sadly, this isn’t Harley-Davidson's first ABS recall in recent years.The quarter-million unit recall—175,000 of which are in the US—is expected to cost the company just shy of $30 million which, like having your brakes fail, is less than ideal. The issue reportedly stems from a faulty ABS module and/or neglected maintenance, both of which have the potential to result in failing calipers. The manufacturer started the recall back in mid-February, and owners of affected vehicles can bring them to a local dealership to have fixed.“This condition is associated with delayed or neglected brake fluid maintenance as specified in the owner’s manual,” stated Carolyn Duranowski, director of marketing at Oakland Harley-Davidson. “Harley-Davidson is offering the remedy fluid flush free of charge to all motorcycles within the recall population, regardless of their maintenance history.”Harley-Davidson was already struggling to sell bikes, and multiple recalls in just eight months definitely isn’t helping to attract new buyers. Luckily the marque has its fully-electric Livewire model on the way, which is sure to turn everything around, so this whole snafu should work itself out. Right?Harley put together a video about how its ABS system works for anyone that’s interested.Photos and video courtesy of Harley-Davidson"

The new X1, X2, X3, and X4 are already on the market, and now it’s time for the larger X5 to undergo a complete overhaul. Seen here is a prototype of the model, spied testing during the final stages of development somewhere in Germany.Take a look at the front. Do you see it? The radiator grille – it’s gigantic! With every new generation, the X5 keeps getting more and more pronounced kidney grilles, but we have to admit they look good on this prototype. That’s probably true because the LED headlights also appear to be slightly bigger, while the air intakes in the bumper are now more aggressively-shaped.At the back, the camouflage makes the taillights look like the Peugeot 3008/5008 duo, but in the final production form they’ll have nothing in common with the French SUVs. BMW will use a single large cluster at each side with LED technology and a distinctive light signature.Other than that, the new X5 will keep its overall size and shape almost unchanged despite the new CLAR architecture. Expect to see only a minor bump in the dimensions which, combined with the new underpinnings, should result in considerably more room in the cabin.On the engine front, don’t look for drastic changes in the lineup, as the current turbo gasoline and diesel engines will carry over, but will be tweaked to deliver better fuel economy and slightly more power. A plug-in hybrid version is also in the cards, as is a range-topping X5 M with a 4.4-liter biturbo V8.On the same platform BMW will also develop the larger X7 with three rows of seat. There are also rumors for an even more opulent X8, but nothing is confirmed at the moment.Photos: Automedia"
