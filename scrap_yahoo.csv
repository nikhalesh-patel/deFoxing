b'Phil Bredesen is a Democrat who thinks he can win in Tennessee. He might be right.',https://www.yahoo.com/news/phil-bredesen-democrat-thinks-can-win-tennessee-might-right-090011825.html,"FRANKLIN, Tenn. — For Tennessee Republicans, Williamson County has long been considered the promised land — one of the reddest counties in what has increasingly become one of the reddest states in the country.An affluent suburb south of Nashville, Williamson is idyllic, with quaint main streets and rolling green hills where some of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War took place. But in state politics, it is regarded as the land of surrender for Democrats, a county so firmly controlled by Republicans at every level that the other party often barely competes.Just one Democrat has won here in the last 20 years — and as it happens, that candidate, former Gov. Phil Bredesen, was back in town on a recent Monday afternoon looking for votes. Nearly eight years after leaving the governor’s office, Bredesen, 74, recently emerged from political retirement to run for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Bob Corker, the moderate Republican and off-and-on critic of President Trump who announced last fall that he would not seek reelection.A poll of registered voters released Thursday by Middle Tennessee State University showed Bredesen with a ten-point lead over his likely Republican opponent, Rep. Marsha Blackburn.Bredesen is not just any other Democrat in Tennessee. One of the most popular public officials in state history, the former Nashville mayor and businessman won two terms in the governor’s office and was the last Democrat to win a statewide election in this firmly red state thanks to a broad base of bipartisan support. His surprise decision to jump into the race in December put Tennessee’s Senate campaign on the national map, giving Democrats a slim chance at regaining control of the U.S. Senate this fall and an opportunity to reestablish a foothold in a region where the party has been largely wiped out.But on the campaign trail the former governor rarely, if ever, mentions his own party affiliation. And he pointedly ignores questions about the national significance of the race. Unlike other Democrats this election year who have placed their opposition to Trump at the center of their campaign, Bredesen, a political centrist, has strenuously worked to avoid being cast as a member of the resistance. When Bredesen does mention the president, it is to declare, as he did in a recent campaign ad, that he is “not running against Donald Trump” but rather “to represent the people of Tennessee.”Bredesen’s careful middle-of-the-road approach is a study in contrast with Blackburn, a hard-charging, eight-term member of the House with one of the most conservative voting records in Washington.A regular on the 24-hour cable news circuit, Blackburn, 65, has been one of Trump’s most passionate allies. And she has made that loyalty to the president front and center in her Senate bid, embracing him and his agenda in ways that other Republicans have not during this closely watched midterm election year. “People want to have a U.S. Senate that’s going to support the president,” Blackburn has said. “I will stand with President Trump.”In a video announcing her Senate bid last fall, Blackburn, whose home district includes Williamson County, came out guns blazing, telling voters about the pistol she packs in her purse. She declared war on her own party, calling out Senate Republicans who “act like Democrats or worse,” and ticked off the ways she would support Trump’s agenda, including on immigration.Describing herself as “hard-core” and “politically incorrect and proud of it,” Blackburn embraced her reputation as a conservative firebrand. “I know the left calls me a wingnut, or a knuckle-dragging conservative. And you know what? I say that’s all right, bring it on.”In an equally fiery speech in late February to Williamson County Republicans, Blackburn, who still faces a likely primary challenge, blasted unnamed Democrats who would dare think they could try to win the Senate seat or any other race in this staunchly conservative state. “They think they can turn Tennessee blue. But they’re not even gonna turn it purple because they are running into the red wall, and the red wall starts right here in Williamson County,” Blackburn declared.Bredesen’s visit to Williamson County came just a few days after Blackburn’s speech.While he made no mention of his likely opponent, his stop seemed to be a quiet, but pointed effort to suggest that “red wall” she talked about wasn’t so impenetrable.The former governor sat at a packed table of about a dozen people right in the front window of Puckett’s Grocery, a popular local eatery barely two blocks from Blackburn’s district office in downtown Franklin. The group included some prominent Republicans like Aubrey Preston, a developer and philanthropist from Franklin who has contributed tens of thousands of dollars to GOP candidates, including Blackburn. But he was also part of a “Republicans for Bredesen” group during the former governor’s last campaign. Bredesen filmed his campaign announcement video at Preston’s home.The conversation focused on local issues like land preservation, a hot topic in this rapidly developing part of middle Tennessee. Meanwhile, Bredesen’s first ad had just launched on local television and on cable networks including Fox News. It featured Bredesen talking up his record as someone who had “worked across party lines … with Democrats and with Republicans” — bipartisanship he emphasized when talking to voters here.A fiscal conservative known for his moderate approach and willingness to work with Republicans, Bredesen won his 2006 reelection race by a landslide, capturing 70 percent of the vote in what even then was a strongly red state. And in that race, he did what no other candidate had done before or since: He carried all 95 counties in the state — including Williamson County, a particularly surprising victory since that’s where his GOP opponent was from. “Even Jesus would have had a hard time carrying 95 counties” in Tennessee, Rep. Jim Cooper, a “Blue Dog” (moderate) Democrat whose district includes Nashville, joked at the time. But that was 12 years ago.While early polls in the Senate race suggest voters remember and still like him, Bredesen faces a political landscape that is dramatically different than when he last ran for office. Elected Democrats have gone nearly extinct. And though the state had a long tradition of electing moderate lawmakers from both parties, pragmatic politicians like Bredesen have mostly retired or been voted out.It raises the question of whether a candidate, even one as widely admired as Bredesen, can persuade voters in an era of unprecedented political polarization to look beyond party labels on Election Day.The race is sure to have broad national implications, beyond the battle for control of the Senate, in which Democrats need to win just two additional seats to regain a majority. Tennessee’s race will help answer whether the electorate still wants lawmakers who can govern in the middle.Bredesen says his gut tells him there are people like him who are tired of what he describes as “the super-hyperpartisanship” that has torn the country apart and left Washington at a standstill. Even so, he admits to polling to make sure he wasn’t embarking on a “suicide mission.” The results were promising enough to persuade him to jump into the race, but they didn’t suggest an easy path to victory. He readily admits this will be a harder race than any he has run before.Not only will Bredesen have to win over a wide swath of Republicans across the state, including voters who voted for and continue to back Trump, he will have to do so while also energizing and holding support among Democrats who may be more conservative than in other states but still want to see a candidate who is willing to take on Trump more aggressively.Still, the 74-year-old ex-governor, who had long resisted entreaties from Democrats to take on other campaigns over the years, felt an almost moral obligation to make the race. “No one can fix Washington,” he said, “unless you try.”Bredesen never saw Trump coming. But he was less surprised than most when the former reality television star rode a populist wave of support from rural and working class voters into the White House in 2016. He had been warning his own party about losing ground among that electorate for years.As governor, Bredesen had sensed resentment building among voters who felt left behind by both political parties. When the economy went south in 2008, in what would later be known as the Great Recession, the unemployment rate rose as high as 20 percent in some parts of Tennessee.At the time, Bredesen reached out to lawmakers in Washington from both parties as they looked for answers. “I thought there was nobody in that town who had any idea what it was like for these people lying in bed at night and just seeing all these things that they had hoped for, for themselves, for their families, just sort of disappearing because of some crazy Wall Street banker somewhere,” he said.Nobody, Bredesen said, seemed to truly grasp “the fear and frustration” felt by working-class Americans who have never fully recovered even as much of the rest of the nation has rebounded back. He has been particularly critical of his own party, describing Democrats as “tone-deaf” to voters in small-town America, who tend to be more culturally conservative and who turned out for Trump in droves.“The Democrats, nationally, have done a great job of alienating a lot of voters with this kind of holier-than-thou superiority about a certain type of voter,” Bredesen said. “What was Hillary [Clinton]’s term? Oh yes, deplorables.”Long before the era of Trump, Bredesen had been sounding the alarm for Democrats on the party’s messaging. In the summer of 2007, he appeared before the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), a group of party centrists who had gained influence during Bill Clinton’s presidency, where he said Dems desperately needed to find a way to reconnect with rural and blue-collar workers, especially in the South.“If you asked me what the Republicans stand for, I could tell you in about 25 words: a traditional view of family, a central role for faith, low taxes, an assertive and combative view of American interests abroad,” Bredesen said at the time. He went on: “I challenge you to describe what the Democratic Party stands for in 25 words. You can’t do it. We’re just defining ourselves by what we’re not. We’re just criticizing the failure of others.”History shows that the Democrats recaptured the White House in 2008, but the party continued to lose ground, and congressional representation, in states like Tennessee. Today, even the DLC no longer exists, having closed its doors in 2011.Eleven years later, Bredesen offers a tight smile when asked about the speech and the suggestions he made to his party back then. “We didn’t do that, and Donald Trump is president,” he said matter-of-factly.In a state where Trump won by 26 points, Bredesen is noticeably careful about how he talks about the president. He has repeatedly told reporters he does not want to be perceived as running against Trump — a line that eventually made it into a campaign ad in which the former governor, speaking to someone off camera, insists that he could find common ground with Trump and “separate the message from the messenger.”“There’s a lot of things I don’t personally like about Donald Trump, but he’s the president of the United States, and if he has an idea and is pushing something that I think [is] good for the people of Tennessee, I’m going to be for it,” Bredesen declared in the campaign ad, a variation of what he often tells voters on the trail.The ad did not mention any specific Trump policies, and Bredesen so far has not detailed areas of common ground between him and the president. He often pairs his Trump critiques to complaints about dysfunction in Washington in general.“I don’t like the way this country and the way the media in this country has made everything about that person,” Bredesen said in an interview, referring to the president. “I think of Donald Trump more as a symptom than a first cause. And I think that symptom is that we as a party, … [and] a lot of Republicans too, have been tone-deaf to a lot of people who have been affected by globalization and technology and have got real concerns.”Bredesen is quick to add that he doesn’t “have all the answers or solutions.” But in a subtle critique of Trump that is characteristic of his tone in the race, he added, “I think there are certainly better answers than demonizing every immigrant or starting trade wars or something like that.”In some ways, Bredesen is an unlikely messenger for Red State Democrats. He’s not even from Tennessee. A Yankee transplant, he’s a native of Shortsville, N.Y., a small town 30 miles southeast of Rochester. While running for governor, he neutralized what could have been a liability in a state where rural voters are instinctively suspicious of outsiders by turning that detail of his biography into a plus. He explained to rural voters how he had grown up poor in a small town just like theirs. His father had left the family when he was a kid, so he and his mother, who worked as a bank teller, lived with his grandmother, who kept the family afloat by doing alterations and sewing.But he went to Harvard (on a scholarship) and left rural New York for Boston in the mid-1960s. But Bredesen insists the mindset of a small town guy has shaped his years in public life. “While I live in an urban area now, I am basically a rural person,” he said.Many of his relatives back in New York had voted for Trump and still support the president. “I don’t look at that as, ‘Well only racists or crazy people do that,’” he said. “I look at it as lots of reasonable people in this world are so estranged from what is happening in Washington that they want to see something different.”A science whiz who was obsessed with space, Bredesen earned a degree in physics in 1967. After graduating he became a computer programmer, and after a brief stint in London moved to Nashville in 1975 with his wife, Andrea, a registered nurse who worked for a hospital management company. In 1980, working from a computer in his den, Bredesen founded HealthAmerica, a company that acquired and ran health management organizations. As he often tells voters, he went $10,000 into debt launching the company, but by the time he sold it in 1986, it was a $700 million a year company with 6,000 employees and traded on the New York Stock Exchange.The sale made Bredesen rich. A financial disclosure form filed last week as part of his Senate campaign offered a broad view of his personal wealth. The former governor reported he held investment assets ranging in value between $88.9 million and $358 million between January 2017 and February 2018. And he reported income from $3.3 million to $20.1 million during the same period — an overall net worth that would make him one of the richest members of Congress if elected.His strength as a candidate is that he doesn’t come across as a rich guy or an elite businessman. While he tends to do more listening than talking — once describing himself as “the strong silent type” — he is calm and measured, without being stuffy, and speaks the language of everyday Tennesseans.Bredesen frequently mentions the “Walmart test” he has applied throughout his own career and has encouraged others in his party to adopt. In it, he imagines how a voter in Walmart might react if he tried to sell them on a policy. “I just imagine myself stopping a couple in the aisle of a Walmart in Winchester, Tenn., or someplace like that, and explaining to them what I was trying to do, and why and so on,” he explained. “If I could see them nodding their heads, they don’t need to agree or disagree, but if they were saying they could at least understand what I was trying to do, I felt like maybe I was on the right track.”The former governor has also presented himself as an avid sportsman and a strong supporter of gun rights. During his first bid for governor, Bredesen scored political points when he took a sporting group up on its offer to demonstrate his trap shooting skills alongside his Republican opponent, who didn’t show up. The National Rifle Association gave him high ratings — until he vetoed a bill allowing guns in bars. “Alcohol and guns just shouldn’t mix,” he said at the time. His veto was overridden by the Republican-led state legislature.While he still mentions his support for the Second Amendment, and wore a hunting vest for the video in which he announced his candidacy, Bredesen has more recently endorsed tougher gun laws, including stronger background checks. But he has stopped short of saying he wants to ban the kind of assault rifle used in the Parkland, Fla., attack. In a race likely to attract heavy spending from outside groups, that may be enough to keep the NRA from an all-out attack on Bredesen.Public polling in the Senate race has been scant so far — and mostly from partisan sources — but all suggest a tight contest between Bredesen and Blackburn among likely voters heading into November.Perhaps the best indicator of the closeness of the race came in recent weeks when word leaked that some Republicans, both in and out of Tennessee, were pressing Corker to reconsider his decision to retire. They reportedly voiced concerns Blackburn may be too conservative to win independents or could alienate mainstream Republicans, who have broken with their party to back Bredesen in the past. In February, Colleen Conway-Welch, the widow of Ted Welch, a major Republican donor, made headlines when she hosted a fundraiser for Bredesen.Last month, Corker confirmed that he had considered reentering the race, but said he was sticking with retirement, though he declined to endorse Blackburn. He has said he should remain neutral ahead of the August primary. But some have wondered if he will endorse in the race at all because of his friendly relationship with Bredesen, who has known Corker, a former mayor of Chattanooga, for years.The ex-governor says he spoke to Corker “numerous” times about the Senate race when he was still deciding whether he would run. He wanted to make sure Corker was really out of the race. And he quizzed him about what serving in the Senate is really like and whether he would enjoy it, telling reporters that Corker knows him well enough to gauge his “frustration” level. “We’ve been friends a long time,” Bredesen said.There has some buzzing in GOP circles about the remote chance that Corker might endorse Bredesen over Blackburn — given he is more politically aligned with the centrist Democrat than the conservative Republican congresswoman. But a GOP consultant close to Corker, who declined to be named to speak more freely about the race, doubts that would happen. “More likely, he would just remain silent, but his silence would say everything to the Howard Baker wing of the party,” the consultant said, referring to the late Republican senator and former aide to Ronald Reagan who championed bipartisanism. Blackburn, he said, “will need real help there.”In numbers that have been seized upon by Bredesen and his supporters, a recent Vanderbilt poll found that Tennessee voters tend to be more moderate than recent election results might suggest. According to the survey, about 62 percent of those polled said they regarded their fellow state residents as “conservative or very conservative.” But 48 percent said they viewed their own political leanings that way — a 14-point difference between perception and reality. Thirty-one percent of those surveyed described themselves as politically moderate.Blackburn has one important ally: Trump, who has a 48 percent approval among Tennessee voters, according to the Vanderbilt poll — much higher than his average approval rating nationwide. But as in other parts of the country, Trump has lost ground in Tennessee. His approval was down 12 points compared to November 2016. In a potential warning sign for Blackburn and other Republicans here, the poll found just 35 percent surveyed felt Trump is changing Washington for the better, a 24-point drop since he was elected.The same survey found little public thirst for some of the red meat issues that Trump championed during his first 14 months in office, including a crackdown on illegal immigration. Just 6 percent of those polled said the issue should be a top priority for Trump and Congress. Fifty-eight percent said illegal immigrants in the country should be allowed to stay and work, while 72 percent said they support allowing the children of illegal immigrants to be eligible for the in-state tuition rate at Tennessee colleges and universities — numbers that have increased since Trump was elected.“It’s not clear to me that the right wing is still as strong in the state as some people think,” said John Geer, a Vanderbilt political scientist who helped oversee the poll. “They write letters, and they attend rallies, and they call their representative, but the state still has a strong pragmatic brand.”Even many Republicans are skeptical Blackburn can go after Bredesen as a flaming liberal Democrat who would fall in lockstep with GOP boogeyman like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. But she’s trying. Her campaign already regularly refers to the ex-governor as “the No. 1 recruit” of Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader from New York and leading Trump critic who played a role in convincing Bredesen to join the race. Republicans argue that whether Bredesen is a moderate or not, he would be a reliable vote for the Democratic agenda.But Bredesen dismisses the critique he would just be another Democratic foot soldier. “People know me,” he said. “I’ve got a good record of not being that way.”He points back to his time as governor, when he worked with Republicans to balance the state budget. During that era, he made what he still describes as the most heart-wrenching decision he ever made as governor — trimming 200,000 people from the rolls of TennCare, the state’s Medicaid system for the elderly and the poor. It was a politically treacherous choice, but one later credited as saving the program.His experience with TennCare and trying to figure out health care in the state later made him a leading critic of Obama’s Affordable Care Act, which he complained would put a huge fiscal strain on states. Though he reiterates that he does not support an outright repeal of Obamacare, Bredesen has said he is running in part to fix the law and plans to unveil a series of policies later this year aimed at bringing costs down and shoring up the plan — not unlike what he did with TennCare.He knows that many lawmakers before him have headed to Washington with good intentions, only to get mired in the swamp. He frequently cites a Republican, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, as lawmaker he admires for trying to rise above politics and make deals, as the kind of senator he would like to be, but he doesn’t have “delusions” that things will be fixed overnight.But in reemerging at this place and time, Bredesen also admits he “sure wouldn’t mind” showing Democrats how to win again with rural and blue-collar voters who used to be the party’s base. Few listened to him 11 years ago, but maybe they will now._____Read more from Yahoo News: "
"b'Protesters Demand Justice For Saheed Vassell, Unarmed Black Man Shot By Cops In NYC'",https://www.yahoo.com/news/protesters-demand-justice-saheed-vassell-001730922.html,"Hundreds of people rallied in New York City on Thursday evening to call for justice for Saheed Vassell, an unarmed black man who was shot by police the day before.Activists gathered in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, where New York City police shot at the 34-year-old father 10 times and killed him on Wednesday.Police were responding to reports of a man wielding a gun, but later determined that the object Vassell had allegedly pointed at them was “a pipe with some sort of knob on the end of it.”Standing on the corner where her son, who had bipolar disorder, had been killed the day before, Vassell’s mother, Lorna, gave an emotional address to the crowd.“He did not deserve [for] a piece of iron in his hand for a cop to kill him,” she said, adding that her son came from a good family and was well loved by all who knew him. “It’s unjustified, and I want justice. They murdered my son, and I want justice for him.”She also questioned why police didn’t simply shoot her son in his leg ― echoing the grandmother of Stephon Clark, another unarmed black man shot by police last month in Sacramento, California. Protests over Clark’s death have not stopped.Community showed up for #SaheedVassell. #Brooklyn#CrownHeights#BlackLivesMatterpic.twitter.com/H2YiWJmjvaAt the rally for Vassell, Women’s March leader and activist Linda Sarsour, who is from Brooklyn, called for the officers who shot Vassell to go to jail.Another unidentified speaker at the rally demanded an investigation into the killing.“They’re shooting us like birds, and it needs to stop,” he said. “People have to be held responsible for this. We need to check these police officers and lock them up.”On Thursday, the office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said it was opening an investigation into Vassell’s death.Mourners at the rally in Brooklyn chanted the now-familiar slogans against the repeated police killings of black people.“No justice, no peace,” activists cried out. “Say his name!”“Saheed!” the crowd yelled back.  A growing crowd of protesters then took to the streets of Brooklyn, marching to the 71st Police Precinct blocks away.A massive crowd is now in the streets of #Brooklyn marching for #SaheedVassell#BLM#StolenDreamspic.twitter.com/38scB5lIHEwaves keep coming: “hands up!

b'Body Of CDC Scientist Missing Since February Found In Georgia River',https://www.yahoo.com/news/body-cdc-scientist-missing-since-213929453.html,"A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientist who mysteriously vanished seven weeks ago has been found dead in a river in northwest Atlanta, authorities said on Thursday.Timothy Cunningham’s remains were found Tuesday evening by fishermen along the Chattahoochee River in a rural area that had been previously searched and is not easily accessible by foot, authorities said at a press conference.The 35-year-old, who was last seen on Feb. 12, did not have any signs of injuries or foul play to his body and the preliminary results of an autopsy determined that he likely drowned, Fulton County Medical Examiner Jan Gorniak said.Whether his death was an accident or suicide has not yet been determined, said Gorniak, who later added that the condition of his body was consistent with that of a person missing for several weeks.Atlanta Police Department Major Michael O’Connor said the river is located fairly close to Cunningham’s house and that he was known to go for runs.“We do know that he was a jogger and he was wearing his favorite jogging shoes at the time that he was found,” O’Connor said. “I can’t tell you that he was jogging but those things together seem to indicate that that is a possibility.”Cunningham was a highly respected epidemiologist at the CDC; last year he was listed among the Atlanta Business Chronicle’s 40 Under 40 list.He was last seen leaving work early after telling his colleagues that he didn’t feel well. Police later said he’d been passed up for a promotion, though the CDC disputed this.After days and then weeks passed without clues on his whereabouts, conspiracy theories about his disappearance grew. One popular rumor was that he was a whistle-blower who had warned others at the CDC that the vaccine used for the flu season had caused some of the high number of deaths from the illness.O’Connor addressed that rumor last month, noting that Cunningham was with the chronic disease unit and not the infectious disease unit. He also didn’t have access to classified material.A search of Cunningham’s home shortly after his disappearance recovered his cell phone, keys and wallet, something O’Connor had described as unusual. When his body was discovered, authorities said they found three crystals inside one of his pockets, which were items O’Connor said Cunningham was known to collect.UPDATE: The Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office has identified the body recovered in the Chattahoochee River in NW Atlanta late Tuesday to be missing CDC employee Timothy Cunningham. A press conference will be held at 2 p.m. ET at APD Headquarters on the investigation. pic.twitter.com/PlAGiqHO5PBased on the evidence gathered so far, O’Connor said the investigation is “likely going to draw mostly to a close,” though he said he is still waiting for a final report from the medical examiner’s office.This story has been updated to include more details about Cunningham’s workplace promotion."

b'An Anti-Sinclair Spot Is Expected To Air 175 Times On 4 Sinclair Stations',https://www.yahoo.com/news/anti-sinclair-spot-expected-air-170633863.html,"The viral video showing a dizzying array of local news anchors reciting the same script authored by their stations’ conservative owner, the Sinclair Broadcasting Group, is coming soon to the homes of Sinclair customers across the country.That is, if the broadcaster doesn’t reject it first. Allied Progress, a left-leaning consumer watchdog group based in Washington, D.C., borrows the alarming mashup for a new 30-second spot that takes aim at Sinclair, which is under fire for requiring journalists to read a statement last month parroting some of the anti-media language used by President Donald Trump. Allied said Thursday it has sunk six figures into an ad buy on four stations in the Sinclair network: ABC affiliates WJLA in Washington and KOMO in Seattle, and Fox affiliates KDSM in Des Moines and WBFF in Baltimore, which also happens to be Sinclair’s flagship station. The spot was slated to run a total of about 175 times over the course of one week, beginning Friday, Allied Progress Executive Director Karl Frisch told HuffPost Thursday. Frisch noted Friday that Allied is still working with Sinclair to schedule the ad space and hopes to have the ads begin over the weekend. He confirmed that ads in Des Moines are set to begin running Saturday afternoon. However, the Seattle station has yet to grant final approval on the spot.Sinclair did not return a request for comment about the ad.Frisch said Thursday that an uptick in contributions to Allied may allow it to purchase even more airtime ― if it’s allowed.“It is certainly a test for the company,” Frisch said. While it’s been silent on the ad buy so far, Sinclair could still refuse to air it. Reaching 40 percent of U.S. households, Sinclair is the nation’s largest owner of local TV stations and is poised to greatly expand its influence. If the company is successful in its bid to overtake Tribune Media, it will reach an estimated 72 percent of U.S. households. The deal is currently under review by the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice. Allied’s spot urges viewers to contact the FCC and demand it shut down the merger.The commission’s inspector general, David Hunt, is already investigating whether its chairman, Ajit Pai, has acted improperly to benefit Sinclair regarding the deal.Sinclair faced sharp criticism in the past week after a video showed dozens of its local news anchors warning viewers about “the troubling trend of irresponsible, one-sided news stories plaguing our country” including the “sharing of biased and false news.”“The problem with what Sinclair does is they co-opt the credibility that local anchors have built up in their communities over years and decades,” Aaron Weiss, a former Sinclair news director, told CNN Wednesday. Some current Sinclair journalists have also spoken out against the script ― one of the company’s many conservative “must-run” segments ― but others fear backlash from their employer.The company’s leadership emphatically defended its decision, which also garnered praise from the president himself. This article has been updated to note that Karl Frisch said Friday that Allied Progress is still working to schedule the ads and hopes they will begin running over the weekend."
b'Democrats hope teacher strikes will mobilize support for midterms',https://www.yahoo.com/news/democrats-hope-teacher-strikes-will-mobilize-support-midterms-140004396.html,"With public school teachers taking a stand over low pay and dwindling education budgets in several Republican majority states, Democrats are sensing another opportunity to make inroads in the 2018 midterm elections.After decades of championing private charter schools, school vouchers and tax cuts that gut budgets for public education, Republicans in states like West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Arizona now find themselves the targets of angry teachers.“Teachers are just fed up. We’re done,” Teresa Danks, a third-grade teacher at Grimes Elementary School in Tulsa, Okla., told Yahoo News.The founder of the nonprofit Begging for Education, which solicits donations to pay for classroom supplies in a state that ranks 47th in per-student funding, Danks has joined fellow teachers this week in a walkout at the state Capitol protesting low pay.“I talked to some Republicans in the Capitol yesterday and said to them, ‘The Republicans are really getting slammed because it seems like they want to dismantle public education. If that’s the case, the Republican Party should own that,’” Danks said.“Teachers want more,” Oklahoma’s Republican Gov. Mary Fallin told CBS News on Tuesday. “But it’s kind of like having a teenage kid that wants a better car.” When pressed over the lack of raises for teachers over the past several years, the governor said, “Well, it has been a difficult time and that’s why I’m very proud that this year we were able to get something done for our teachers.”Under pressure, Oklahoma legislators last week passed the state’s first major sales-tax hike (on cigarettes, fuel, lodging, oil and gas production) in nearly 25 years, hoping to raise enough revenue to avert a teacher strike. But Danks says the roughly $6,000 raise isn’t enough, and points to a failed vote earlier in the year on a measure that would have given public school teachers a long overdue raise as proof that lawmakers still don’t get it.“It was a final straw. A lot of us said, that’s it. We’ve had enough. I started a petition,” Danks said. “Teachers have gotten to the point where we feel we’re being disrespected. We’re being treated like we’re not important. Our jobs are viewed as glorified babysitting.”Slideshow: Oklahoma teachers go on strike and rally at State Capitol >>>Oklahoma ranked 49 out of 50 states in terms of teacher salaries, according to a 2016 report by the National Education Association. In part, that’s why teachers have balked at the $6,000 raise. Danks wants the state to pay raises closer to $10,000, and notes that she has been forced to spend up to $2,000 of her own money each year on school supplies for her classroom.“We are in the classroom every day fighting for these kids and we’re living the nightmare of not having what we need, of having textbooks from when Bill Clinton was president, not enough paper, broken chairs and desks,” Danks said.As the Oklahoma teachers’ walkout continues, Danks hopes political pressure will continue to mount on state legislators.“When this becomes an inconvenience to the parents and they get angry, that’s another whole level of voting power,” Danks said. “Our goal after we finish at the Capitol is to keep reminding parents of who is voting for education and who is not.”In Arizona, Democratic state Sen. Steve Farley has made education the central focus of his campaign to unseat Republican Gov. Doug Ducey. One of three Democrats vying for the right to challenge Ducey in November, Farley, whose parents were both public school teachers, sees an opening for his party.“Since the ’90s our public education system has been under attack by forces that want to privatize and destroy it,” Farley said. “We’ve been on the forefront of charter schools and private school vouchers, things to try and take money away from our public education system. After the Great Recession, hit we saw dramatic cuts to our public school budgets. We’re at an absolute crisis point now.”Farley believes public school funding and teacher pay are crossover issues that will help him prevail in a race that Real Clear Politics currently describes as leaning Republican.“I’m traveling all over the state for this campaign and I’m seeing the support for increased funding for education at a level I’ve never seen before. It’s not just from Democrats. It’s from Independents and Republicans,” Farley said. “Remember back in the day when a Chamber of Commerce Republican would attend a ribbon-cutting for a new public school? It was a proud addition to a community that everybody was proud of. I think that’s still the way a whole lot of Republicans feel.”Slideshow: West Virginia teachers’ strike >>>With another teacher pay demonstration held in Tucson on Wednesday, public education funding shows no sign of fading as an issue ahead of the midterm elections, and national Democrats have taken notice.“Democrats are proud to stand with all the teachers making their voice heard,” Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, tweeted Tuesday.Like many Democrats, Farley sees most Republican office holders as wedded to tax cuts, even at the expense of the public school system. It’s a platform that starts with Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, a longtime champion of voucher programs and charter schools. DeVos’s disastrous March interview with “60 Minutes,” in which she admitted she hadn’t visited underperforming public schools and had difficulty explaining her own education policies.But Farley remains optimistic that solutions for fixing Arizona’s public schools are within reach.“The fact is, we have the money to pay for our education system. Gov. Ducey and this Republican legislature have chosen to give it away with corporate tax cuts,” Farley said.Patrick Ptak, a spokesman for Ducey, said the governor “believes more needs to be done to drive up teacher salaries. Average teacher pay in Arizona is $48,372. Since 2015, school districts have increased their investment in teacher salaries by 9 percent. In 2017, we saw an increase of 4.3 percent in teacher average salaries. Today we rank 43 among the states according to the National Education Association, and are rising.”In January, Ducey announced a plan that sought to reverse recession-era cuts to education and to settle a $1.6 billion lawsuit brought against the state by Arizona school districts over inadequate funding.“We know Gov. Ducey and his supporters are terrified right now,” Farley said. “Since January, the Koch brothers have been funneling dark money into these advertisements that have been wall to wall on television all over the state trying to say that Ducey has invested $1.5 billion into education and that he’s a great governor. All the figures are total lies, completely made up.”Jeanie Smith, a social studies teacher at Drakes Middle School in Bowling Green, Ky., decided this year that the time was right to push for education — by running for the state Senate herself.“As a teacher, I see what my community needs every day,” Smith, who is one of 32 educators to file to run for a seat in the Kentucky legislature this year, told Yahoo News. “In Kentucky, there’s really an attack on education, and it has been in the works for years, with the introduction of charter schools, defunding our public schools and an attack on teacher pensions. You could say that all of that came together, and I realized that running was something I needed to do, that we couldn’t afford to have our legislators jeopardizing education any more.”Another state in which Republicans control the statehouse and both chambers of the legislature, Kentucky saw teacher walkouts last week after the passage of S.B. 151, which weakens state pensions for teachers.“Republicans right now have control of both the House and the Senate, and we have a Republican governor, so they are very much in control, and they are pushing these things through,” Smith said.Smith’s opponent this fall will be State Sen. Mike Wilson, former chairman of the Senate Education Committee. Wilson, who did not return requests to be interviewed for this article, helped pass permanent charter school funding in the state, a bill Smith strongly opposed.Like Farley, Smith thinks many Republican voters have been turned off by their party’s apparent disdain for public education.“I have Republicans coming to me, thanking me for running because they want someone they can trust. They trust teachers,” Smith said. “People are ready for change. Education should not be a partisan issue. We love our schools here in Warren County, and people are upset that they are under threat.”Whether Democrats can capitalize on the growing outrage being expressed by teachers nationwide remains to be seen. But Smith is hopeful.“It is absolutely going to impact Kentucky. I am a perfect example. I’m a teacher and I am running to win,” Smith said. “Our campaign is including a lot of people who feel like they’re being left behind, and I am absolutely sure we’re going to see some big changes in November.”Read more from Yahoo News:"
b'America vs. China in South China Sea: Aircraft Carrier Face-Off Now In the Cards?',https://www.yahoo.com/news/america-vs-china-south-china-132800878.html,"Asia TimesSecurity, America vs. China in South China Sea: Aircraft Carrier Face-Off Now In the Cards?China’s only aircraft carrier in service, the Liaoning, is now in the South China Sea for a six-day drill that began on Thursday, state papers have confirmed.Reuters has also reported that the Liaoning strike group has sailed into waters close to the southern province of Hainan, flanked by 40 other warships and submarines, as seen in a satellite image.Observers believe these vessels may be from the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s three major fleets, as Beijing wants a variety of vessels from different naval command regions to sail with the Liaoning to hone their inter-fleet interoperability.Yet it appears that the Chinese carrier has no intention of strutting its stuff in waters troubled by territorial disputes. Chinese papers say the exercise is meant to address the slew of flaws and deficiencies that have been exposed in the years since the inauguration of the ship, which began its PLA Navy service as a refurbished Soviet hull.Recommended: The 5 Biggest Nuclear Bomb Tests (From All 6 Nuclear Powers).Recommended: How Israel Takes U.S. Weapons and Makes Them Better.Recommended: North Korea’s Most Lethal Weapon Isn’t Nukes.Global Times has also noted that to attain a genuine blue-water-navy stature, the PLA’s maritime force still has a lot of catching up to do. One aspect is the evolution from a mixed-combat model to a carrier-oriented one to cope with more missions and voyages in the high seas.Beijing adopted a dovish tone when the US aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, nicknamed “the Big Stick,” arrived in Singapore for a scheduled port visit and R&R this week, and the Nimitz-class nuclear-powered carrier’s strike group has joined forces with warships from allies while en route to the center of the South China Sea.The strike group includes the guided-missile cruiser USS Bunker Hilland guided-missile destroyer USS Sampson, according to Singapore’s Straits Times newspaper.Meanwhile, the European Union’s head of security policy, Francois Rivasseau, told The Australian Financial Review that the possibility of European navies conducting “freedom of navigation” patrols in the South China Sea could not be ruled out in the future.The US, Japan, Australia and India are promoting cooperation through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, and Britain is reportedly considering sending a warship to the region as well.Still, a China-US carrier-to-carrier face-off in the South China Sea is highly unlikely given the obvious disparity in capabilities.Analysts outside China now have a clearer understanding of the Liaoning, after years of observation and a close-up look at the carrier when it was docked in Hong Kong last July.The consensus appears to be that the Liaoning is more like “a big toy” for symbolic deterrence, a training carrier with deficiencies resulting from its design and retrofit, as well as the Chinese navy’s inexperience in marshaling a modern sea-going strike group, even though PLA generals and sailors are quick learners.Meanwhile a separate report appeared in the PLA Daily on Thursday saying that the current drill was meant to test “new navigation and communication systems as well as new planes” mounted on the carrier, without providing further details of the new installations.A commentary that appeared in on the website of China News Service said the focus of the latest Liaoning deployment should be on its fleet of new shipborne fighters, as the J-15, a copycat of the antiquated Soviet-designed Sukhoi Su-33, is a non-starter in wrestling air superiority against the short-takeoff and vertical-landing variant of America’s stealthy F-35s.People’s Daily revealed earlier this year that the J-31, a twin-engine, mid-size fifth-generation jet fighter, was nearing introduction, with more trials scheduled this year.“The J-31 can pair up with J-15s and J-20s in the future in tasks of both high and low altitudes, both onshore and offshore,” that report said.This first appeared in AsiaTimes here. Read full article"

b'Woman Who Says Mormon Church Failed To Discipline Her Abuser Files Lawsuit',https://www.yahoo.com/news/woman-says-mormon-church-failed-014506903.html,"A woman who accused a former Mormon leader of rape filed a civil lawsuit against the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on Wednesday, claiming the church did not properly respond when she reported the abuse decades ago.McKenna Denson, 55, says she was raped in 1984 by Joseph L. Bishop, the former president of a Mormon missionary training center (MTC) in Provo, Utah. Denson said she told local Mormon leaders about the assault numerous times over the years, but that the church failed to take action against the leader.Instead, she says, Bishop was allowed to continue holding leadership positions that placed him in charge of hundreds of Mormon youth. Denson said that after trying to seek justice through the church for three decades, she’s “absolutely prepared” to fight it in court. “I’m ready for this,” Denson said Thursday during a press conference in Salt Lake City. “I’ve been ready. I think what makes me feel even more confident [is], I’m right. It happened. I was raped at the MTC. The church covered it up, and they still promoted him to higher and higher positions of the church.”Bishop, who is now 85 years old, denies the rape allegations. In an interview with police last year, he admitted that he had taken Denson to a small “preparation room” at the center and “asked her to show him her breasts, which she did.” Church spokesman Eric Hawkins told HuffPost in an email that the church is confident that the legal system will ensure a just result in this case.“Our hearts ache for all survivors of abuse, and the Church is committed to addressing incidents of abuse wherever they are found,” Hawkins wrote. “As this is now an active legal matter, we are unable to make further comment at this time.”In a previous statement, the church claimed that it did not impose formal discipline on Bishop because it was unable to verify the allegations against him. The church said it is investigating the alleged rape again and would take action against Bishop if it found the claims to be true.Denson’s lawsuit names Bishop and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as defendants, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. Denson’s lawyer, Craig Vernon, said his client is seeking to hold Bishop accountable and that he hopes the lawsuit will also reveal systematic problems the church’s handling of abuse allegations.On March 26, the church updated its guidelines on abuse prevention. The guidelines instruct church leaders to call a church helpline when they learn of possible abuse cases. The helpline reportedly connects the leaders to “legal and clinical professionals” who provide instructions on how to assist victims and comply with local requirements about reporting abuse. Vernon said he wants the church to consider telling its leaders to take complaints directly to local authorities.“We want the church to consider whether it makes sense to instruct [leaders], if you find out about one of these crimes ... don’t call the helpline, call the police,” he said during Thursday’s press conference.Denson also brought up the church’s longheld practice of allowing local leaders, known as bishops, to conduct one-on-one “worthiness” interviews with young children. Some parents have complained that bishops are able to ask children invasive questions about their sexuality during these interviews. The interviews have recently become a controversial subject in the Mormon church. Last week, about 1,000 people marched to the church’s headquarters to demand an end to the practice and make it a requirement for a parent or guardian to sit in on the interviews. The church’s updated abuse guidelines make this an option, not a requirement.In response to a petition from concerned Mormon parents, Hawkins, the church spokesman, issued a statement last December defending bishops’ interviews as an important part of the church’s ministry. Denson said Bishop was able to groom her for abuse because she had already gotten used to the idea that it was OK to be alone in a room with an older man who asked her sexually explicit questions. She said the movement to change the church’s policies on bishop’s interviews was “absolutely vital” to her.“If I had been taught early on that it was not OK to be alone, one on one with a priesthood leader, no matter how high up he is, I honestly believe this would not have happened,” she said.Related Video: Mormon Woman Opens Center for LGBTQ YouthFor more news videos visit Yahoo View."

b'Atlantic Fires Kevin Williamson After Suddenly Realizing He Believes The Things He Says',https://www.yahoo.com/news/kevin-williams-fired-atlantic-memo-184116537.html,"In an email to his staff Thursday afternoon, The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, announced that recently hired opinion columnist Kevin Williamson was fired after Goldberg realized that Williamson did, in fact, believe his own words that women should be hanged for having abortions. Earlier Thursday, a company-wide event had been scheduled in which Atlantic editor Adrienne LaFrance was set to interview Williamson in front of staff, according to several Atlantic employees, but the meeting was canceled at the last minute. Goldberg announced Williamson’s firing just hours later, though a similar interview with Ta-Nehisi Coates scheduled for Friday appears to be going on as planned.This news comes just weeks after The Atlantic announced Williamson’s hiring, which immediately sparked an uproar from people concerned that the publication was giving space to a man who compared a 9-year-old black child to a primate and, now most famously, said that women who get abortions should be hanged. It apparently wasn’t until Media Matters’ report on Wednesday, which found that Williamson had defended the sentiment on a podcast, that Goldberg decided to take Williamson’s remarks seriously.In a previous memo to staffers defending Williamson’s hiring, Goldberg had said, “I have disagreed with him more than I have agreed with him (an irrelevant metric when you’re the editor; not when you’re a reader), but I recognized the power, contrariness, wit, and smart construction of many of his pieces.” He also took care to note that Williamson was “prolific,” which is certainly true.Among that body of prolific writing full of “wit” and “smart constructions” is a piece that notes that “there is something maddeningly sexy about a woman enforcing rules, and something sexually repugnant about a woman without any rules at all.” There’s also the article titled “Like a Boss,” which claims, “From an evolutionary point of view, Mitt Romney should get 100 percent of the female vote. All of it. He should get Michelle Obama’s vote. You can insert your own Mormon polygamy joke here, but the ladies do tend to flock to successful executives and entrepreneurs.” Why Goldberg was unable to determine, based on Williamson’s extensive body of work, that Williamson very much believed all the things he had written down for years remains unclear.You can read the email Goldberg sent to staffers below: Dear All, Last week, I wrote you about our decision to hire Kevin Williamson. In that note, I mentioned my belief that Kevin would represent an important addition to our roster of ideas columnists, and I addressed the controversy surrounding some of his past tweeting and writing. I expressed my belief that no one’s life work should be judged by an intemperate tweet, and that such an episode should not necessarily stop someone from having a fruitful career at The Atlantic. Late yesterday afternoon, information came to our attention that has caused us to reconsider this relationship. Specifically, the subject of one of Kevin’s most controversial tweets was also a centerpiece of a podcast discussion in which Kevin explained his views on the subject of the death penalty and abortion. The language he used in this podcast—and in my conversations with him in recent days—made it clear that the original tweet did, in fact, represent his carefully considered views. The tweet was not merely an impulsive, decontextualized, heat-of-the-moment post, as Kevin had explained it. Furthermore, the language used in the podcast was callous and violent. This runs contrary to The Atlantic’s tradition of respectful, well-reasoned debate, and to the values of our workplace. Kevin is a gifted writer, and he has been nothing but professional in all of our interactions. But I have come to the conclusion that The Atlantic is not the best fit for his talents, and so we are parting ways.We remain committed to grappling with complex moral issues in our journalism. Some of our colleagues are pro-life, and some are pro-choice; we have pro-death -penalty and anti-death-penalty writers; we have liberals and conservatives. WE obviously understood that Kevin himself is pro-life when we asked him to write for us. This is not about Kevin’s views on abortion.We are striving here to be a big-tent journalism organization at a time of national fracturing. We will continue to build a newsroom that is, as The Atlantic’s founding manifesto states, “of no party or clique.” We are also an organization that values a spirit of generosity and collegiality. We must strive to uphold that standard as well.JeffThis is a developing story. Please check back for updates."

b'EPA Ethics Official Walks Back Defense Of Scott Pruitt&apos;s Condo Rental',https://www.yahoo.com/news/epa-ethics-official-walks-back-100119622.html,"The Environmental Protection Agency’s lead ethics official this week walked back his defense of administrator Scott Pruitt’s controversial condo rental.The official, Kevin Minoli, said last week that Pruitt’s rental of a room co-owned by the wife of an energy lobbyist didn’t violate federal gift rules and that the $50-a-night rate was within “reasonable market value.” But in a new memo first obtained by CNN, Minoli claimed that he hadn’t had all the facts before issuing his defense.In the Apr. 4 memo, he clarified that last week’s comments were based only on the provisions of the lease, but did not cover ways Pruitt may have used the condo that fell outside of the terms of the deal.“Some have raised questions whether the actual use of the space was consistent with the terms of the lease,” Minoli wrote in the document. “Evaluating those questions would have required factual information that was not before us and the review does not address those questions.”Minoli did not say that there were any ethical violations and once again claimed that the terms of the lease were reasonable.Pruitt is nevertheless facing intense scrutiny over the rental, a sweetheart deal that let him use the room whenever he liked and only pay for it on the nights that he slept there. The condo is co-owned by Vicki Hart, whose husband runs Williams & Jensen, a well-known energy lobbying firm.While Minoli’s original assessment said the deal was above-board, some EPA officials reportedly said Pruitt’s daughter stayed in the unit’s second bedroom while working at the White House last year, according to The Washington Post. The lease would not have covered that arrangement, a detail that Minoli said he had not considered.“The review addressed the terms of the lease as they were written in the lease agreement only,” the April 4 memo reads.Hart has said she did not know that Pruitt’s daughter was staying in the condo, and told ABC News last week that she “never gave him permission” to use the other bedroom.Walter Schaub, the former head of the Office of Government Ethics, noted that if Pruitt’s daughter was using the other room and Hart knew about it, the $50 rate could be well below market value and possibly qualify as a gift.“If it turns out Pruitt’s daughter was staying in the other room, that’s not covered by the ethics opinion because it’s outside the scope of the lease,” Shaub told CNN. “It would raise a factual question as to whether the landlord knew and permitted his use of the second room, which would be a gift.”You can review those comparables yourself and see what you think of them in terms of location and quality. As for what happened after the lease was signed, I think the question turns on how Pruitt used the property and what the landlord knew about that. /5The Post notes that the EPA’s ethics office only learned about Pruitt’s use of the room last week and Minoli’s approval came months after Pruitt stopped using it.Pruitt has also drawn criticism over reports that the EPA approved a pipeline expansion project for a company that employed Williams & Jensen as lobbyists at the same time he rented the room. Both the EPA and the firm have denied that Pruitt was lobbied on the deal.“There is no connection between decisions Administrator Pruitt has made at EPA and any place he has lived,” EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman told the Post and CNN on Wednesday night. “Any attempt to draw that link is patently false.”"
b'Fears of fresh violence ahead of new Gaza protest',https://www.yahoo.com/news/fears-fresh-violence-ahead-gaza-protest-113112389.html,"Gaza City (Palestinian Territories) (AFP) - Thousands of Palestinians are expected to rally at Gaza's border Friday despite warnings from Israel that its open-fire rules will not change, raising fears of fresh violence after the the bloodiest day for Gazans in years.The planned demonstration comes a week after Israeli troops killed 18 Palestinians during a protest at the heavily fortified Gaza border in what was the bloodiest day since a 2014 war.The protests are in support of refugees, including those in the Palestinian enclave who want to return to their former homes in what is now Israel.Tens of thousands demonstrated peacefully last Friday. But small groups of Palestinians approached the border, threw stones and rolled burning tyres towards Israeli troops who responded with live fire and tear gas.The Israeli response generated significant international anger, with critics accusing troops of using disproportionate force.But Israel has remained adamant such steps were needed to protect troops from an alleged gun attack by militants and stop attempts to infiltrate the border.Ahead of Friday's planned protests Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman vowed that open-fire rules would not change.""If there are provocations, there will be a reaction of the harshest kind like last week,"" Lieberman told public radio.Israel received support from the White House late Thursday, which called for Palestinians to engage in peaceful protest and stay 500 meters from Gaza's border with Israel.""The United States strongly urges protest leaders to communicate loudly and clearly that protestors should march peacefully; should abstain from all forms of violence,"" Donald Trump's envoy Jason Greenblatt said, putting the onus squarely on Palestinians.- Peace process? -The latest White House statement would appear to put Trump's claimed aim of reaching a peace deal between Palestinians and Israelis even further out of reach.Palestinians have already been infuriated by Trump's decision to upend decades of US policy and recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital.The current protests at Gaza's border are slated to last six week, coinciding with the expected opening of the new US embassy in Jerusalem in mid-May.Others have been more critical of Israel, calling on security forces to avoid a repeat of last week's killings.""I particularly urge Israel to exercise extreme caution with the use of force in order to avoid casualties,"" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said Thursday. ""Civilians must be able to exercise their right to demonstrate peacefully.""Questions have mounted over Israel's use of live fire, with Palestinians saying protesters were shot at while posing no threat to soldiers.Rights groups have criticised the army's actions, while the European Union and Guterres have called for an independent investigation.Human Rights Watch called the deaths ""calculated"" and illegal.Protest organisers in Gaza said they were planning to try to stop smaller numbers of demonstrators approaching the fence and hurling stones or rolling burning tyres at Israeli troops.Asaad abu Sharkh, a spokesman and member of the organising committee of the protests, dubbed the Great March of Return, said better attempts will be made on Friday to keep Gazans from approaching the fence.""I think this was a mistake, a mistake of organisation from us because we shouldn't have let people (go to the border),"" he said.""But at the same time we were not expecting the Israelis to shoot to kill.""- Stockpiling tyres -There have been widespread social media calls for protesters to bring tyres to burn. Young Palestinians have been gathering tyres and carting them near the border to burn and create a smokescreen to make it harder for Israeli snipers.Some have been walking the streets collecting money to buy tyres.Israel accuses Hamas, the Islamist movement that runs the Gaza Strip and with whom it has fought three wars since 2008, of using the protests as cover to carry out violence.Israeli military spokesman Ronen Manelis warned again Thursday of a wider response if such alleged activity continued.Israel says more than half of the dead were members of militant groups, including the armed wing of Hamas.Hamas's armed wing has claimed only five of them, saying they were participating ""in popular events side-by-side with their people"".Militant group Islamic Jihad has claimed at least one of the dead as a member, but said he was not carrying a weapon when he was shot.On Thursday in Khan Yunis in southern Gaza, Abu Yassin, 28, was among those collecting tyres and hauling them in carts pulled by motorbikes.He said they were planning to light a number of tyres a few yards away from each other along the border at the same time to make it impossible for Israeli soldiers to see and shoot them.""This is a peaceful protest,"" he insisted."

Don’t let your voice be silenced, you can now share your story #StoriesUntoldpic.twitter.com/dVn99eyJ85Students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School have started a project to give their peers from underrepresented groups a larger platform on which to share their experiences with gun violence.A small group of students at the Parkland, Florida, school where 17 people were killed in a mass shooting in February, launched a new Twitter account and hashtag, #StoriesUntold, on Monday.The online campaign ― started by 17-year-old junior Carlitos Rodriguez, who is Latino, and a handful of his friends, mostly teens of color ― is meant to amplify the stories of people affected by gun violence who feel unheard, particularly their Stoneman Douglas classmates of color. Some of those students say the media have not recognized them as much as they have highlighted their white peers.“Our school is very diverse and the media is not representing us,” Rodriguez told HuffPost on Thursday. He noted that while nearly 40 percent of Stoneman Douglas’ 3,000 or so students are nonwhite, the majority of the students getting the most media attention are those at the forefront of the March For Our Lives movement, and they are largely white.“We want to represent the minorities that are not in the media ― the Latinos, African-Americans, Asians. Our voices are very powerful,” he said.We all have different stories, and we all deserve an opportunity to share them! Diversity also must be celebrated and included in the media! We want inclusion, and we want to be well represented! #StoriesUntold@StoriesUntoldUS#StoriesUntold is an organization put together by my friends to give minorities a platform to share their stories + ideas related to gun violence. to all black, hispanic/latinx, asian, + poc who have been affected, please send your videos to @StoriesUntoldUS we won’t be silencedIn the few days since the Stories Untold account was launched, it has largely retweeted Parkland students describing their experiences of the Feb. 14 shooting. Many of the tweets share students’ traumatic stories of watching their peers and teachers being shot. Some students are sharing their stories publicly for the first time.“We have so many students who were inside that building texting us because they can’t keep their pain any longer,” Rodriguez said. “They need to share it with someone. And their story matters.”i will scream and cry for someone to listen to us. the ones who witnessed seeing their classmates die. THE ACTUAL SURVIVORS #storiesuntoldpic.twitter.com/V9LyhfSiIvI know that it is late but I can’t keep my story in anymore. Hi my name is Elissa Castellanos I’m a junior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas and this is my untold story of Valentine’s Day. #MSDStrong#StoriesUntoldpic.twitter.com/4MW9FFQfi9#StoriesUntold this is my story... 1/2 pic.twitter.com/cyrsFxwXfKUltimately, the project aims to expand its focus and feature more stories of people affected by gun violence beyond Stoneman Douglas, Rodriguez said ― specifically from communities of color, which are disproportionately affected by gun violence.Her name is Jamahri Sydnor. She was shot and killed in DC days before she was to start her first day of college at @FAMU_1887 after driving through crossfire with her little cousin in the car. Her life mattered, and her story matters. #StoriesUntoldpic.twitter.com/iupFaJb9M7Last week, a group of black students at the school held a news conference to express that their voices weren’t being sufficiently heard ― by the media or their peers.Rodriguez echoed those students’ feelings, in both applauding their now-famous classmates like Emma González and David Hogg for their efforts to make the teen-led movement more inclusive and pushing for them to feature more voices of their own black and brown peers. “We just want inclusion ― and to be able to share our stories,” Rodriguez said, noting that March For Our Lives student leaders like González are their friends and support the Stories Untold project.“We’re all truly fighting for one cause,” he added. “We’re just adding more fire to this movement.”Many students deal with gun violence every day, from police to immigration agents. These experiences, as Parkland survivors, are unique and need to be shared. RT #StoriesUntold#NeverAgain"
"b'Video blogger who opened fire at YouTube was angry with company, police say'",https://www.yahoo.com/news/video-blogger-opened-fire-youtube-angry-company-police-000948977--finance.html,"By Paresh Dave and Heather SomervilleSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - An Iranian-born woman who blogged about surviving in a world filled with ""injustice and diseases"" opened fire at YouTube's California headquarters because she was angry at a site she believed was suppressing her videos, police said on Wednesday.In Persian and English-language online postings, Nasim Najafi Aghdam, 39, had railed against the video-sharing site owned by Alphabet Inc's Google before wounding three people and killing herself on Tuesday at its offices in San Bruno, just south of San Francisco.In an English-language video posted to her YouTube account before the channel was deleted on Tuesday, Aghdam said, ""I am being discriminated. I am being filtered on YouTube.""""We know that she was upset with YouTube ... that's the motivation,"" San Bruno Police Chief Ed Barberini told reporters. ""Whether that rises to the level of terrorism hopefully will be determined in the next couple of weeks.""The shooting on the corporate campus in California's Silicon Valley came days after Aghdam had a dispute with her family that caused her to leave her San Diego home. On Monday, they reported her missing, police said.Early the next day, Mountain View police found Aghdam sleeping in her car a few miles from Alphabet's headquarters. She was ""calm and cooperative"" with the officers she spoke with, made no mention of YouTube and gave no indication she would harm anyone, Mountain View police said.The San Jose Mercury News quoted Aghdam's father, Ismail Aghdam, as saying he told police that his daughter might go to YouTube's headquarters because she hated the company but Mountain view police disputed that account.Police said officers had twice spoken with the family after finding her. In an initial call, Aghdam's father said nothing about his daughter posing a threat but then called back to say she had posted vegan videos to YouTube and was angry about something that had been done to them, police said.""At no point did her father or brother mention anything about potential acts of violence,"" the statement said.Efforts to reach Aghdam's relatives by phone were unsuccessful.Video: YouTube Shooting Suspect's Family Claims Warnings MissedHowever, Los Angeles television station KTLA and other media reported on Wednesday that Aghdam's family in a statement expressed sorrow over the shooting and support for the victims.""Our family is in absolute shock and can't make sense of what has happened yesterday,"" the family said, according to KTLA.Aghdam entered the YouTube parking garage and walked to an open-air plaza, where she opened fire. But she was not able to walk into the building itself, YouTube said in a statement on Wednesday.YouTube is ""revisiting this incident in detail"" and will increase security at its offices worldwide, the company said.Aghdam did not appear to have targeted particular victims when she opened fire with a legally purchased Smith & Wesson 9mm semiautomatic handgun, the San Bruno police chief said.Aghdam had visited an area gun range that morning, police said.In some online posts before the attack, Aghdam spoke about herself in heroic terms for surviving in a hostile world.""I think I am doing a great job,"" she wrote in Persian on her Instagram account. ""I have never fallen in love and have never got married. I have no physical and psychological diseases. But I live on a planet that is full of injustice and diseases.""In videos posted on her YouTube channels, which were taken down on Tuesday, Aghdam alternately bemoaned animal cruelty, promoted what appeared to be handmade jewelry and demonstrated exercise techniques. She offered few specifics about what she believed had been suppressed, other than to complain that her workout videos had been flagged as adults-only content.YouTube has long faced complaints about alleged censorship on its site, and says it attempts to balance its mission of fostering free speech while providing an appropriate and lawful environment for users.One of her three victims, a man in his 30s, remained in San Francisco General Hospital in serious condition on Wednesday, the hospital said. Two others were released Tuesday night, it said.(Reporting by Paresh Dave and Heather Somerville; additional reporting by Parisa Hafezi in ANKARA, Gina Cherelus in NEW YORK, Ben Klayman in ANN ARBOR, Michigan, and Alex Dobuzinskis in LOS ANGELES,; Writing by Rich McKay and Scott Malone; Editing by Bill Trott, James Dalgleish and Lisa Shumaker)"

b'Tired of winning yet? You&apos;re not alone.',https://www.yahoo.com/news/tired-winning-yet-youre-not-alone-090032927.html,"These should be President Trump’s best days in office. The tax bill that marked his first (and only) real legislative achievement has grown more popular in recent weeks. His blowhard rhetoric toward North Korea appears to have yielded a rare diplomatic opening. He’s revived a couple of his most resonant campaign themes, slapping tariffs on China and threatening to send soldiers to patrol the southern border.And yet, Trump’s approval ratings seem barely to have budged. According to a series of polls in the last few weeks (leaving aside a single conservative-leaning outlier), four in 10 Americans, give or take, are happy with his presidency.How can this be?Trump loyalists will point out that his ratings are several points higher than his all-time low, and that no less revered a president than Ronald Reagan was in the same ballpark at this time in his presidency. But Reagan was battling a prolonged recession; Trump should be riding a wave of recovery.No, a Trump Malaise descends on the country, and it can only be about one thing, as the president himself surely understands. After all, he warned us it would happen, and now his prophecy has come to pass.We’re tired of winning already.We laughed at the oracle when he made this prediction. But we didn’t really hear him.When Trump first started appearing on our television screens as a candidate, sometimes for hours at a time without paying a dollar for the privilege or being interrupted by any pesky interviewers, America was beset by pessimism.For decades, we had watched as automation and the rise of foreign manufacturers decimated our industries and hollowed out whole communities. We had seen America’s preeminent role as a superpower shaken by rivals with nuclear ambitions and by zealots living in caves.“Win the future” had been one of President Obama’s hundred slogans — for about 10 minutes, anyway. The truth was we were fighting the future to a draw, at best, and everybody knew it.And then along came Trump, like a real-life Music Man with a truckload of fetching red hats. If he became president, Trump said, America would all of a sudden start winning again. Our rural areas and small cities would bounce back. Our borders would be safe. Our government would work for everyone. There was just one catch. We’d win so much, Trump said, that we’d eventually grow tired of winning. He knew what he was talking about. Because Trump had been winning all his life.He was born a winner, with a dad who made a small fortune in real estate. He gambled that fortune on big-city skyscrapers and faux-classic casinos and exclusive golf courses the color of money, and he won again and again, if you don’t count a couple of nettlesome bankruptcies and a huge payout to victims of his scam university. (And, you know, the frozen steaks.)So Trump understood how empty winning can be. How you think it’s going to soothe all your demons and wipe away all your cares, how you assume that once your team finally wins the championship you will wake up every morning with a smile on your face, but in the end it just leads to a void of disappointment and self-doubt.And here we are.Trump’s been pretty much the president he said he would be, even before he seized control of his own administration a few weeks ago and started replacing milquetoast policymakers with like-minded TV celebrities.He’s told the Europeans and other allies who relied on our leadership for the last century to go figure things out for themselves.He’s done his damnedest to discredit the entire idea of America as a nation of immigrants who share common values.He’s responded to the Russian czar’s threat to nuke Florida by congratulating him on his hard-fought fake-election win and suggesting he visit Washington.Thanks to Trump’s tax cuts and military buildup, we’re now rocketing toward an economic calamity in which just servicing the interest on our spiraling debt, coupled with our other obligations, will push interest rates higher and crowd out almost everything else the federal government does.Oh, I know what you’re saying: This doesn’t sound like winning at all. But that’s only because you misunderstood what Trump was trying to say.Trump doesn’t define winning the way you and I do. It’s not about giving back or improving people’s lives; as I’ve written before, Trump has never done that anywhere, unless you count remodeling a skating rink.Winning, in Trump’s mind, wasn’t about us. It was about him.It’s about ratings and primacy. Trump wants more than anything to exist outside of himself, to occupy your screens and your emotions. He always has.Losing, to Trump, is receding from center stage. Winning is finding one way after another to keep us riveted to the show.So Trump is absolutely delivering on his promise. He’s winning and winning and winning. Every day, it seems, he taps some new well of audacity, willing himself to become the overarching story of our time. Even the reimagining of an old TV sitcom becomes a national conversation not because of anything that happens on the show itself, but because of what its star says about Trump, in the script and in real life. They should call it “Roseanne in Trumpland.”Another win for the president.And yes, we’re winning, too. Because like it or not, America has become the world’s Donald Trump. We’re shameless, unpredictable, outrageous. We’re a never-ending spectacle from which no one can look away. We’re the topic of all conversation, too.We horrify and fascinate, and then we get up the next morning and somehow figure out how to do it again.And we haven’t yet seen just how crazy and sordid this whole Russia investigation might become, dragging the country into yet another prolonged legal drama with unbelievable ratings, amazing, like you’ve never seen.Of course Trump’s idea of winning feels deflating to most of us. It’s exhausting. It’s disorienting. It’s like putting your face up to an industrial fan every hour of the day.It seeps into our dreams — all this dissembling and smallness and provocation bursting onto our TV crawls and iPhone screens — and when we wake up, we’re not an inch closer to giving our kids the America we promised them.But you can’t really blame the president. He told us right from the start that we’d get tired of the whole noisy routine.We were just too busy gawking to listen.Read more from Yahoo News:"

My question is: Will you pledge to submit to a DNA test to prove that you’re human?”Cruz didn’t directly answer. “Well, ma’am, thank you for that, and one of the great things about our democratic system is we can treat each other with respect and civility,” he said. “Is that a yes or a no?” she shot back. “Ma’am, if you want to engage in insults, that’s your prerogative, but I’m not going to reciprocate,” he said.   (h/t The Hill)Related Video: Sen.

Khan, who was taken into custody Thursday, was also fined 10,000 Indian rupees ($154).Four other actors who starred in the film with Khan and were also charged in the incident have been acquitted.Khan, 52, who pleaded not guilty, can appeal the case to a higher court. If the appeal is accepted, he could be granted bail or even have his sentence overturned.The ruling is not the actor’s first run-in with the law. In December 2015, Khan was cleared in a 2002 hit-and-run case in which a homeless man died.He had also been acquitted in three previous cases related to poaching and possession of firearms, according to the BBC."

They also discussed refugee and repatriations issues, the exchange of prisoners and finalization of the Afghanistan-Pakistan Action Plan for peace and solidarity.Abbasi, accompanied by several other top Pakistani officials on the trip, his first to Kabul since becoming prime minister last year, is to hold meetings with a string of Afghan officials, according to Ghani's spokesman, Shah Hussain Murtazawi.Pakistan has been under pressure from Kabul and Washington to stop offering safe havens to militants blamed for attacks in Afghanistan, a charge Islamabad denies.Pakistan, widely believed to be the only party that can bring the Taliban to the negotiating table, also insists its influence over the insurgents has been exaggerated.Kabul and Islamabad regularly trade accusations of harboring the other country's militants and the harsh language has underscored the strains between them.Late on Thursday, Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement rejecting a claim made by Kabul that Pakistan violated Afghan airspace with Pakistani Air Force raids inside Afghan territory during counter-terrorism operations earlier in the week.The statement said information about the ongoing ""operations is shared with the Afghan security forces on a regular basis."" In the latest military actions, Pakistan told the Afghan about them and stressed that these operations were on Pakistani side of the border, it said.Islamabad accuses Kabul of failing to take action against militant groups who continue to attack Pakistan from their sanctuaries across the border in Afghanistan.""Pakistan urges Afghanistan to focus on taking effective counter-terrorism actions, including plugging in of large gaps existing along the Afghan side of Pakistan-Afghanistan border,"" the statement said, adding that ""it is also important that the Afghan government should refrain from the blame game.""Also on Thursday, Javid Faisal, deputy spokesman for Afghanistan's chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah, said that Pakistan's support was critical to talks with the Taliban and that Abbasi's visit would help improve the troubled Afghan-Pakistan relations.In January, President Donald Trump lashed out at Pakistan, saying the United States had ""foolishly"" given Pakistan more than $33 billion in aid over the last 15 years and had gotten nothing in return but ""lies & deceit."" Washington later confirmed it is withholding $255 million in U.S. military aid to Pakistan this year.___Associated Press writers Kathy Gannon in Islamabad and Amir Shah in Kabul, Afghanistan, contributed to this report."

Baked sweet potatoes’ glycemic index is still not very high, and they’re still recommended as a healthier alternative to white potatoes. However, if you’re diabetic, you need to regulate your insulin levels for any reason or you’re just looking to cut back on sugars, you may want to rethink the way you eat sweet potatoes.The good news: there are simple ways to prepare sweet potatoes that can produce a dramatically lower GI, compared to baking them. We’ll show you how to do that, but first, let’s get to the root of this to understand what happens when you eat a baked sweet potato.A glycemic index (GI) is a way of ranking carbohydrate-containing foods according to their immediate effects on blood sugar levels. Carbs with a low GI (which are considered to be the most diabetic-friendly) are more slowly digested, causing a slower rise in insulin levels, whereas foods with a high GI, such as white bread and table sugar, are quickly digested and make our insulin levels skyrocket.That means foods with a high GI are also way more likely to make you hangry.A low GI is defined as 55 and under, intermediate is 56 to 69, and high is 70 and above.In the case of tubers like potatoes and sweet potatoes, we often overlook their incredible potential to convert from starch to sugar. Sweet potatoes may not be sold in a bakery box, but they still contain chains of glucose like other sugary foods ― the difference is that a sweet potato’s glucose comes packaged in a plant, not in a cookie or cake.As health journalist Max Lugavere explains in his book Genius Foods, our bodies can turn starch into sugar molecules with ridiculous ease. This conversion process begins even before you swallow your food, when an enzyme in your saliva called amylase begins to break down starch. But your body isn’t the only thing that converts starch to sugar. Cooking does it, too.The nutrition facts for raw and baked sweet potatoes can be vastly different. One cup of raw sweet potato may contain 114 calories, 26.8 grams of carbs and 5.6 g sugar, whereas one cup of baked sweet potato may contain 180 calories, 41.4 g carbs and 16.9 g sugar. That’s a big increase in carbs and sugars. But why?Here’s the scientific explanation: Heat breaks down starch granules, which allows amylopectin and amylose (the two polysaccharides that form starch) to be more readily digested by pancreatic amylase (an enzyme), which turns starch into maltose (a sugar).Here’s the layperson’s explanation: Heat breaks down the starch in sweet potatoes in a way that allows your body to easily convert that starch into sugar, which spikes your blood sugar levels.So what does that specifically mean in the case of sweet potatoes?A study conducted in 2016 subjected 11 types of sweet potatoes to three different cooking methods ― baking, microwaving and steaming ― to determine each method’s effect on the food’s glycemic index. And the differences were notable.“Cooking Treatment Effects On Sugar Profiles And Sweetness of Eleven-Released Sweet Potato Varieties,” published in the Journal of Food Processing & Technology, found that the GI for a raw sweet potato started at 15 and that baking increased it the most (33), microwaving the least (18), and steaming came in somewhere in the middle.The longer a sweet potato is exposed to heat, the study found, the more its GI is likely to increase. The sweet potatoes were baked in a conventional oven for 60-90 minutes at 180-220°C ― which is much longer than they would be microwaved or steamed. Researchers concluded that the longer cooking time at high temperatures “resulted in the highest sugar formation.”Baking also employs dry heat, which dehydrates the sweet potato, degrades its starches, concentrates its sugars and therefore increases the sugar content and glycemic index.Conversely, the microwave exposed the food to heat for the shortest amount of time and increased the sweet potato’s GI the least. The study cited the technique’s “rapid heating mechanism” as being responsible for actually deactivating part of the process that turns starch into sugar. No matter how you cook a sweet potato, it’s important to note that there are numerous varieties with different GIs. A 2012 study published in The Open Nutrition Journal, titled “Glycemic index of sweet potato as affected by cooking methods,” worked with the popular Beauregard variety, which has a raw GI of 32. The earlier study found that cooking a sweet potato approximately doubles the GI.According to the 2016 findings, if you want sweet potatoes with the lowest GI, you should basically do anything but bake them.Don’t run off, however, and eat a bunch of sweet potatoes raw. The reason we cook them in the first place is to make them easier to digest. When heating breaks down those starch granules, it prevents you from experiencing certain embarrassing digestive issues.But you can eat raw sweet potatoes in small quantities without much trouble. And unlike white potatoes, they don’t contain the dangerous enzyme solanine in their raw state.These are a few ways to cook and enjoy sweet potatoes, in order from lowest GI to highest:Now that everything’s been explained, just remember not to freak out about eating baked sweet potatoes if you don’t have issues with your blood sugar. Even baked sweet potatoes still have a lower GI than a lot of other foods we consider to be healthy, such as instant oatmeal, brown rice, watermelon or rice milk. And they’re still seriously good for you in so many other ways.Here are some of our favorite ways to cook them:Get the Maple and Brown Sugar Oatmeal with Sweet Potato recipe from Foodie CrushGet the Skinny Tandoori Butter Sweet Potato Fries with Creamy Baked Harissa Feta recipe from Half Baked HarvestGet the Veggie Fajita Stuffed Sweet Potato with a Chipotle Drizzle recipe from How Sweet It IsGet the Sweet Potato, Brie and Bacon Grilled Cheese recipe from How Sweet It IsGet the Southwestern Kale Power Salad with Sweet Potato, Quinoa and Avocado Sauce recipe from Cookie + KateGet the Thai Sweet Potato Soup with Lemongrass and Ginger recipe from Feasting at HomeGet the Winter Chopped Salad with Roasted Sweet Potato and Blood Orange Vinaigrette recipe from How Sweet It IsGet the Sweet Potato Hash with Poached Eggs and Harissa recipe from Feasting at HomeGet the Baked Sweet Potato Chips recipe from Minimalist BakerGet the Sweet Potato Enchiladas recipe from Damn DeliciousGet the Baked Sweet Potato Tater Tots recipe from Minimalist BakerGet the Simple Salty Sweet Potato Skin Chips recipe from Half Baked HarvestGet the Garlic-Herb Roasted Sweet Potatoes with Parmesan recipe from Cooking ClassyGet the Sweet Potato and Black Bean Burrito recipe from Foodie CrushGet the Sweet Potato Almond Butter Muffins recipe from Minimalist BakerGet the Brazilian Steak and Grilled Sweet Potato Fry Quinoa Bowl with Spicy Coconut Tomato Sauce recipe from Half Baked HarvestGet the Sweet Potato Chili Cheese Rounds recipe from How Sweet It IsGet the Sweet Potato and Black Bean Tacos with Avocado-Pepita Dip recipe from Cookie + KateGet the Sweet Potato and Caramelized Onion Pizza recipe from Foodie CrushGet the 5-Ingredient Sweet Potato and Black Bean Chili recipe from Minimalist BakerGet the Buttermilk Sweet Potato Pancakes with Coconut Whipped Cream recipe from How Sweet It IsGet the Superfood Sweet Potato Dessert Fries recipe from Minimalist BakerRelated: Try This Recipe for Sweet Potato Chips"
"b'If you catch a burglar breaking into your home, what are you allowed to do?'",https://www.yahoo.com/news/catch-burglar-breaking-home-allowed-185458545.html,"  What would you do if you apprehended an intruder in your home? It’s a question that has crossed the mind of most of us at some point, and is especially pertinent this week following the arrest of Richard Osborn-Brooks on suspicion of murdering career criminal Henry Vincent. The 37-year-old from Kent was fatally stabbed during a break-in at the pensioner’s home in Hither Green, south east London, on Wednesday. Osborn-Brooks has since been told he will face no charges, but his arrest sparked anger from neighbours.So where do you stand legally, as a homeowner, when responding to a break-in in your house?You can use reasonable force to protect yourself or others if a crime is taking place inside your home.It means you can protect yourself “in the heat of the moment”, including by using an object as a weapon. You are also allowed to stop an intruder running off, for example by tackling them to the ground.There’s no specific definition of this term - it depends on the circumstances. If you only do what you honestly think is necessary at the time, this provides strong evidence that you acted within the law.No, but you could still be prosecuted if, for instance, you continue to attack the intruder even if you’re no longer in danger, or if you pre-plan a trap for someone rather than involve the police.Tony Martin shot dead a teenage burglar in 1999. He was convicted of murder and jailed for life in April 2000 for killing 16 year-old Fred Barras and seriously injuring his accomplice, Brendon Fearon, then 28. The sentence was later reduced to manslaughter.His conviction came after prosecutors argued he had lain in wait for the burglars and shot them in cold blood.Munir Hussain attacked an intruder with a cricket bat after the lives of his family were threatened by knife-wielding burglars in their home in High Wycombe, Bucks, in 2008. He was jailed along with his brother Tokeer after being found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge, who reduced Munir’s sentence in 2010, explained: ""This trial had nothing to do with the right of the householder to defend themselves or their families or their homes.""The burglary was over and the burglars had gone. No one was in any further danger from them."""
b'Chicago suburb bans &#39;assault weapons&#39; after Florida massacre',https://www.yahoo.com/news/chicago-suburb-bans-assault-weapons-florida-massacre-000458777.html,"(Reuters) - An affluent Chicago suburb has banned the possession, sale and manufacture of ""assault weapons"" and ""large-capacity magazines"" in response to the massacre at a Florida high school and other recent mass shootings in the United States.Residents of Democratic-leaning Deerfield, located about 25 miles north of Chicago, have until June 13 to remove any firearms and magazines that fall outside the new restrictions or face a fine of between $250 and $1,000 per day, according to the ordinance passed by the town board on Monday night.The ban quickly drew a legal challenge from gun-rights group Guns Save Life, with support from the National Rifle Association, on grounds it violated Americans' Constitutional rights to own firearms.The Deerfield ordinance said the ban was a direct response to the Feb. 14 killing of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, and the student-led campaign for tighter restrictions on guns inspired by the mass shooting.""We hope that our local decision helps spur state and national leaders to take steps to make our communities safer,” Deerfield Mayor Harriet Rosenthal said in a statement.The ban follows a similar 2013 measure enacted by the nearby suburb of Highland Park, located on Chicago's North Shore, which withstood a challenge that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.Opponents were quick to take issue with the ban.“Every law-abiding villager of Deerfield has the right to protect themselves, their homes, and their loved ones with the firearm that best suits their needs,” Chris Cox, head of the NRA's lobbying arm, said in a statement.Opponents of the ban said they fear Deerfield will try to outlaw other firearms.""First it’s going to be assault rifles. There will be new bans in the future. It’s just a matter of time,” Deerfield resident Larry Nordal told the Chicago Tribune. Nordal did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.The ban defines assault weapons as a range of firearms such as semiautomatic rifles like the AR-15, a gun similar to the one used in the Florida massacre. High-capacity magazines are defined as those holding more than 10 rounds.Deerfield High School senior Ariella Kharasch, who supported the legislation, wants more action on local and national levels.“This is our generation’s fight. We’re going to keep fighting and this is part of it,"" Kharasch told the Chicago Tribune. ""Change happens gradually step by step.”(Reporting by Andrew Hay; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Leslie Adler)"

But a shooting on a campus is highly unusual.Those killed were the deputy dean of the education faculty, faculty secretary and two lecturers at Osmangazi University, the university said in a statement.The attacker, himself a researcher at the education faculty, was later detained after initially trying to flee the scene, the Dogan news agency said. Police were questioning him.State media later reported that the suspect's wife had been detained as part of the investigation.The university's rector Hasan Gonen confirmed to CNN-Turk television that four people had been killed.He said the attacker -- named by state media as Volkan B -- initially went to the dean's office and shot at the others after finding it empty.Gonen described the individual as a ""problematic"" person who had been verbally insulting the academic personnel.""We are launching an investigation into the researcher. He was a problematic person... I believe he targeted the personnel as a result of psychological problems,"" he said.He added the university did not know how the man had entered the university grounds with a gun but did not think the incident had any links to terror. Campuses in Turkey are usually well guarded.- Shock and panic -Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said ""no details would be overlooked"" in the shooting probe.Eskisehir, a city of nearly one million, is on the railway line between Ankara and Istanbul and has rarely been the scene of any kind of violent attack.""We are extremely sad. The chief prosecutor's office is tackling the incident,"" said Eskisehir governor Ozdemir Cakacak.Some reports said the attacker had also upset staff members by alleging that they were members of the group of Fethullah Gulen blamed for the 2016 failed coup.Dogan said that the attack sparked panic at the university, with both students and teachers in a state of shock.Television pictures showed shocked staff and students gathering outside the university's main entrance. Many ambulances were sent to the area.Some pictures showed tearful staff speaking on mobile phones seeking to assure relatives that they were not harmed.Turkey has in recent years been hit by a string of deadly attacks blamed on Kurdish militants and jihadists. However there was no indication of any link between Thursday's shooting and extremist activity."

Her predecessor earned $212,324. Sutton’s new salary is a raise of more than 50 percent from her previous job working for Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas). Brian Johnson, hired as a CFPB senior adviser, makes $239,595. He was sent an offer letter on Dec. 1 with a starting salary of $220,000, but his pay was increased by more than $19,000 by the end of the month.The high pay scale isn’t unusual for the CFPB. Financial regulators offer higher salaries than other Washington agencies ― but both Mulvaney hires are making more than their predecessors and most of their colleagues, the Times said.Disclosure of the fat paychecks comes after President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers have repeatedly advocated reshaping the agency, arguing it has imposed too many regulations on the financial industry, and have tried to cut the amount it pays employees. The latest White House budget proposal recommended a $150 million funding cut. Mulvaney himself, who was White House budget director before Trump installed him at the CFPB in November, submitted a report to Congress on Monday encouraging lawmakers to curb the agency’s powers.“The bureau is far too powerful, and with precious little oversight of its activities,” he said in the report.Mulvaney requested a CFPB budget for the quarter of $0, and said he would fund operations with reserves."
b'Perks await those who cooperate with Mueller&#39;s Russia probe',https://www.yahoo.com/news/muellers-russia-probe-shows-pays-cooperate-045838905.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) — George Papadopoulos, taken by surprise by FBI agents at an airport last summer, now tweets smiling beach selfies with a hashtag for the Greek resort island of Mykonos.Rick Gates, for weeks on home confinement, gets rapid approval for a family vacation and shaves down his potential prison time.Michael Flynn, once targeted in a grand jury investigation, travels cross-country to campaign for a California congressional candidate and books a New York speaking event.It pays to cooperate with the government.That's true in any criminal investigation. It's especially notable in a case as high profile as special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia inquiry, where deals for cooperators have raised speculation about incriminating information they're providing.The perks of cooperation include freer travel, lenient punishment prospects and even public comments by defendants that might have been unthinkable months ago.Compare that with the experiences of Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman who has refused to cooperate and faces decades in prison. And it sends the message that others could receive favorable treatment if they agree to work with investigators.""There's no question that it's in the government's interest to take what steps they can to show that cooperating is in the interest of the defendant,"" said Daniel Petalas, a former federal prosecutor. ""A basic principle of plea bargaining is that you have to make it worth it to the defendant to admit liability in a criminal matter.""The latest example came Tuesday when Dutch lawyer Alex van der Zwaan was sentenced to 30 days in prison for lying to the FBI. Though his deal didn't explicitly require cooperation, the charge he pleaded guilty to carries a maximum five-year sentence and it's almost certain that he risked a longer punishment if convicted at trial. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said some incarceration was necessary to deter others from lying to investigators.Defendants who admit guilt are stained with criminal convictions, may forfeit liberties including the right to vote and put their jobs and reputation at risk. And they can still wind up with tough sentences.Given that uncertainty and stress, it's common for prosecutors looking to induce cooperation to make concessions, such as dismissing charges or agreeing to recommend a lighter sentence, especially for someone they think can help them build a case against a higher-value target.""There is a societal interest, frankly, in having people cooperate with prosecutors because often the government only can know what's happened based on documentary evidence and witnesses that it speaks with,"" said Sharon McCarthy, a former federal prosecutor in New York. ""But insiders who can give insight into conversations and planning and things like that are crucial to being able to make cases.""There's nothing new about cutting deals, including for violent mobsters, but the tactics have drawn renewed scrutiny especially in conservative legal circles.Former Manhattan federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy wrote last month in the National Review that Mueller was shirking Justice Department protocols by offering Gates, Manafort's co-defendant and a onetime Trump campaign aide, a ""penny-ante plea"" instead of requiring him to plead to the most serious charges he faced.Gates was initially charged in October in a 12-count indictment and faced well over a decade in prison. He pleaded guilty in February to just two charges. Under sentencing guidelines, he now faces fewer than six years or less, depending on the extent of his cooperation.He spent weeks on home confinement as a potential flight risk, repeatedly requesting, and generally receiving, permission to attend children's sporting games and holiday events in the region.The home confinement condition was lifted in January. Days after his plea, he filed a motion with the government's blessing asking to be able to ditch his GPS monitoring, but the judge said she was not ready to grant the motion at that time. He did, however, receive approval for a family trip to Boston for spring break, though that plan was aborted after he said threatening comments were posted online.Papadopoulos's carefree tweets, including smiling snapshots of his wife on his lap and beside him at the beach, are a far cry from the frowning mug shot taken after his arrest at Dulles International Airport last summer.Accused of lying to the FBI and facing the possibility of a lengthy sentence, he pleaded guilty in a secret court hearing and agreed to cooperate. Since then, he's resurfaced with a Twitter profile of more than 7,400 followers.Mueller's team includes lawyers with deep experience in organized crime and financial fraud cases, which frequently require flipping witnesses and sometimes involve aggressive maneuvering.Andrew Weissmann, one of the Gates prosecutors, indicted the wife of Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, in 2003. The move was interpreted by some as a way to encourage Fastow himself to plead guilty and cooperate, which he ultimately did by testifying against high-level colleagues.Still, prosecutors understand that juries may look askance at sweetheart plea deals, especially with those who've been publicly demonized, and that defense lawyers may subject cooperators to bruising cross-examinations.""Prosecutors are going to be cognizant that there are always going to be credibility issues with cooperators,"" said former prosecutor Peter Zeidenberg, ""but these are very experienced prosecutors and they're making a decision that, on balance, they're getting something in return.""___Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP___This story has been corrected to say that judge didn't lift GPS monitoring for Gates."

b'Amazon&apos;s Reach Into New Markets Is Helping the Company Shrug Off Trump&apos;s Jabs',https://www.yahoo.com/news/amazon-apos-reach-markets-helping-234401090.html,"(WASHINGTON) — Amazon is spending millions of dollars on lobbying as the global online retailer seeks to expand its reach into a swath of industries that President Donald Trump’s broadsides haven’t come close to hitting.Trump’s attacks over the last week targeted what Amazon is best known for: rapidly shipping just about any product you can imagine to your door. But the company CEO Jeff Bezos founded more than two decades ago is now a sprawling empire that sells groceries in brick-and-mortar stores, hosts the online services of other companies and federal offices in a network of data centers, and even recently branched into health care.Amazon relies on a nearly 30-member in-house lobbying team that’s four times as large as it was three years ago as well as outside firms to influence the lawmakers and federal regulators who can help determine its success. The outside roster includes a retired congressman from Washington state who was a senior member of the powerful House Appropriations Committee when he stepped down.Overall, Amazon spent $15.6 million on lobbying in 2017.“Amazon is just not on an even playing field,” Trump told reporters Thursday aboard Air Force One. “They have a tremendous lobbying effort, in addition to having The Washington Post, which is as far as I’m concerned another lobbyist. But they have a big lobbying effort, one of the biggest, frankly, one of the biggest.”Bezos owns the Post. He and the newspaper have previously declared that Bezos isn’t involved in any journalistic decisions.Earlier in the week, Trump alleged that Amazon is bilking the U.S. Postal Service for being its “delivery boy,” a doubtful claim about a contract that’s actually been judged profitable for the post office. And he has charged that Amazon pays “little or no taxes,” a claim that may have merit. Matthew Gardner, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said in February that Amazon “has built its business model on tax avoidance.” Amazon reported $5.6 billion of U.S. profits in 2017 “and didn’t pay a dime of federal income taxes on it,” according to Gardner.The company declined to comment on Trump’s remarks and did not immediately respond to a request for comment about its lobbying operations.Amazon has grown rapidly since it launched in 1995 as a site that sold books. It has changed the way people buy paper towels, diapers or just about anything else. And its ambitions go far beyond online shopping: its Alexa voice assistant is in tablets, cars and its Echo devices; it runs the Whole Foods grocery chain; the company produces movies and TV shows and it designs its own brands of furniture and clothing.The company is in the midst of launching an independent business with JPMorgan Chase and Berkshire Hathaway that is seeking to lower health care costs for employees at the three companies. Given the three players’ outsize influence the alliance has the potential to shake up how Americans shop for health care and the initiative sent a shudder through the industry when it was announced in January.Amazon Web Services is angling for a much larger share of the federal government’s market for cloud computing, which allows massive amounts of data to be stored and managed on remote servers. The CIA signed a $600 million deal with Amazon in 2013 to build a system to share secure data across the U.S. intelligence community.A partner of Amazon Web Services, the Virginia-based Rean Cloud LLC, in February scored what appeared to be a lucrative cloud computing contract from the Pentagon. But the contract, initially projected to be worth as much as $950 million, was scaled back to $65 million after Amazon’s competitors complained about the award.Lobbying disclosure records filed with the House and Senate show Amazon is engaged on a wide variety of other issues, from trade to transportation to telecommunications. The company also lobbied lawmakers and federal agencies on the testing and operation of unmanned aerial vehicles. Amazon has been exploring the use of drones for deliveries, but current federal rules restrict flying beyond the operator’s line of sight.The $15.6 million Amazon spent on lobbying last year was $2.6 million more than in 2016, according to the disclosure records. The bulk of the money — $12.8 million — went for Amazon’s in-house lobbying team. The nearly 30-member unit is led by Brian Huseman, who worked previously as chief of staff at the Federal Trade Commission and a Justice Department trial attorney.As most large corporations do, Amazon also employs outside lobbying firms — as many as 14 in 2017.In Amazon’s corner is former Washington congressman Norm Dicks of the firm Van Ness Feldman. Dicks was serving as the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee when he ended his 36-year congressional career in 2013. He represented the company on information technology matters and “issues related to cloud computing usage by the federal government,” according to the records, which show Van Ness Feldman earned $160,000 from Amazon last year.Amazon brought aboard four new firms in 2017, according to the records. Newcomers Ballard Partners, BGR Government Affairs, Brownstein Hyatt, and McGuireWoods Consulting lobbied for Amazon on transportation, taxes, drones and other issues."
"b'Chevrolet Cruze, Spark Get Minor Updates For 2019'",https://www.yahoo.com/news/chevrolet-cruze-spark-minor-updates-040201396.html,"Just like the Malibu, both the Cruze and Spark have gone under the knife for a refresh. The two cars have been restyled and revamped, both inside and out, for the 2019 model year, adding a few unique cues that should help them stand out from the previous model year.On the Cruze, the most significant update comes in the front fascia. The grille has been completely restyled throughout the range, on both the sedan and hatchback, with added chrome accents and sharp new detailing around the fog light fixtures, as well as LED signature lighting. Out back, the taillights now come with LED accent lighting, which Chevy says further enhances the all-new look.New wheels, and black accent details around the window moldings and emblem can be found on the RS package. And for the first time, Chevy is offering its hatchback model in an LS trim; the five-door vehicle accounts for about 20 percent of all Cruze sales, says Chevy, so it makes sense to expand the range of offerings.The cabin also gains a few significant updates, particularly a handful of new color options – including ""Umber"" – as well as a standard seven-inch touchscreen with Chevy’s new Infotainment 3. The updated tech adds features like better Bluetooth connectivity, faster processing, more apps, and better graphics overall.As far as power is concerned, the same 1.4-liter four-cylinder gas engine carries over, producing 153 horsepower (114 kilowatts) and 177 pound-feet (239 Newton-meters) of torque, paired to either a six-speed manual, or a six-speed automatic transmission. Buyers interested in diesel can still opt for the powertrain, the same 1.6-liter engine carries over producing 137 hp (102 kW) and 240 lb-ft (325 Nm), paired to either a six-speed manual, or a nine-speed automatic transmission.As for the Spark, most of the same styling updates on the Cruze can be found on the small hatchback, too. A new front fascia with an updated grille and chrome surround accents can be had on the 2019 LS and LT models, and LED daytime running lights are now available on the LT trim exclusively. Exterior colors like Orange Burst Metallic, Passion Fruit, Caribbean Blue Metallic, and Rasberry are available throughout the range.Inside, new safety features like a low-speed collision mitigation system has been added, as well as Chevrolet’s new Infotainment 3. Underhood, the same 98-hp (73-kW) inline-four engine remains, paired to either a five-speed manual or a CVT. The Cruze, the Spark, and the updated Malibu will all go on sale later in the year. No official word on pricing just yet.Source: Chevrolet"
b'Hungarian nationalist PM Orban on track for third straight term in power',https://www.yahoo.com/news/hungary-pm-orban-track-third-straight-term-power-095239768.html,"By Krisztina Than and Gergely SzakacsSZEKESFEHERVAR, Hungary (Reuters) - Viktor Orban, Europe's most outspoken nationalist leader, said on Friday Hungary's future would be decided for decades at an election on Sunday in which he vowed to protect his nation from the ""rust"" of Muslim migrants.After a campaign in which Orban has positioned himself as a saviour of Hungary's Christian culture against Muslim migration into Europe, all opinion polls put his Fidesz party well in the lead for the election.A third straight term for Orban could embolden Hungary's longest serving post-communist premier to solidify a Central European alliance against the European Union's migration policies, and against a deeper integration of the bloc which he opposes.It would also give a lift to other right-wing nationalists in Central Europe, in Poland and in neighbouring Austria, and expose cracks in the 28-nation EU.""We will win again on Sunday as we have won battles in the past which looked impossible for many,"" Orban told a few thousand supporters waving the national flag in the town of Szekesfehervar, west of Budapest.""We have built the fence, defended the southern border ... Migration is like rust that slowly but surely would consume Hungary.""Earlier on Friday he voiced common cause with Poland, whose governing Law and Justice (PiS) party like Fidesz is under fire from the EU over their refusal to take in migrants under a quota system and over their efforts to tighten state control of their courts and media.""We believe Poles and Hungarians have a common path, common fight and common goal: to build and defend our homeland in the form that we want ... Christian and with national values,"" Orban said at the unveiling of a statue marking a 2010 plane crash that killed the Polish president.Poland's PiS leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, attending the ceremony commemorating the plane crash in Russia in which his twin brother was killed, endorsed Orban ahead of Sunday's vote.Orban's Fidesz, with a firm grip on the media, dominates the public agenda. All polls predict a win for him on Sunday though something short of the landslides of elections in 2010 and 2014.There is also a slight chance that the fragmented opposition, with formerly far-right Jobbik as the main challenger, could foil a romp to victory and strip Fidesz of its parliament majority.At a rally in Budapest on Friday, Socialist prime ministerial candidate Gergely Karacsony accused Orban of having abused his strong political mandate.""There is no other man who had so much power and who has abused it so much,"" Karacsony told hundreds of supporters.Orban, 54, who started out as a young liberal activist in the late 1980s, has transformed Hungary's democratic fabric in the past eight years with what his critics see as an increasingly authoritarian style.His government has expanded control over state media and, via business allies, also large chunks of the private media.Businessmen close to Fidesz and Orban have acquired stakes in major industries like banking, energy, construction, and tourism, enriching themselves on EU funds.In clashes with Brussels over his policies, he has ruled out taking part in any EU-wide mechanism to settle migrants from the Middle East in Hungary. Orban has declared that Hungary, which has no history of large-scale immigration, should preserve its ""ethnic homogeneity.""""INVASION"" THREATIn 2015, even before the peak of Europe's migration crisis, Orban realised that the threat from what he called ""an invasion"" by Muslim immigrants struck a chord with a large part of the Hungarian electorate.His government built a fence on the southern border with Serbia to keep out migrants at a time when hundreds of thousands had walked though Hungary on their way to richer western Europe.The Fidesz election campaign has vilified U.S. financier George Soros, whose philanthropy aims to bolster liberal and open-border values in eastern Europe, and runs against Orban's concept of an ""illiberal democracy"".The fierce anti-immigrant campaign has gone down well with around 2 million core voters of Fidesz. According to a poll and estimates by Republikon institute on Thursday, Fidesz could win 113 seats in Hungary's 199-seat parliament.However, the polls could be unreliable as one-third of voters are uncertain and many hide their voting preference.Sitting on a bench in Budapest, enjoying the sun with a cup of coffee in his hand, Istvan Nagy, a 50-year old plumber, said he would vote for Orban as a guarantor of security.""Of course, Fidesz, Viktor Orban! Why? Because he is the only one who makes me feel secure in this country, this is what I have got used to and I want this to remain,"" he said. ""We have a job, and money and also the girls are pretty here.""While Orban has gradually become a nationalist admired by far-right politicians across Europe, he is credited with keeping the budget deficit under control, reducing unemployment and reducing some of Hungary's debt pile.His income tax cuts have put the economy on a growth track, with the economy expanding by 4 percent in 2017 and consumption and lending on the rise.Financial markets have been pricing in a new term for Orban, and have mostly cast aside the chances of a Fidesz defeat.That could trigger a fall in the forint and government bonds in the event of an upset, traders say.(Reporting by Krisztina Than with additional reporting by Sandor Peto; Editing by Mark Heinrich)"

b'Brazil&#39;s Lula negotiates after arrest deadline passes',https://www.yahoo.com/news/brazils-supreme-court-rule-prison-lula-144017022.html,"São Bernardo do Campo (Brazil) (AFP) - Ex-president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Brazil's polarizing election frontrunner and leftist icon, was negotiating his surrender after dramatically skipping a first deadline Friday to start his 12-year prison sentence for corruption.Holed up with thousands of cheering supporters in the metalworkers' union building in his hometown of Sao Bernardo do Campo, near Sao Paulo, the 72-year-old let the 5:00 pm (2000 GMT) deadline pass without public comment.This raised the temperature in the standoff between the leftist former two-term president and Judge Sergio Moro, who heads the mammoth ""Car Wash"" anti-graft probe and who ordered Lula's imprisonment.Given that Lula was effectively surrounded by a human shield, it was clear that a forcible arrest attempt would trigger violence.But authorities took pains to reduce tensions, downplaying Lula's defiance and stressing that he was not considered a fugitive -- something that would trigger a preventative arrest warrant.""Lula did not comply with a judicial order,"" a spokesman for Moro told AFP, ""but everyone knows where he is. He's not hiding or on the run.""- Surrender date still unclear -Politicians from Lula's Workers Party said he would remain in Sao Bernardo do Campo overnight and that his lawyers were in close negotiations with police over the time and place of the arrest.""There is a discussion between police and the ex-president's lawyers and the party is following this. The idea is to avoid the judge ordering preventative arrest, which would aggravate the situation,"" said Congressman Carlos Zarattini.""Nothing is over yet.""Senator Gleisi Hoffmann tweeted that a Catholic Mass would take place at the union building early Saturday in memory of Lula's late wife Marisa Leticia, who died last year and would now be turning 68.According to varying Brazilian media reports, Lula was considering surrendering after the Mass or possibly holding out through the weekend.Much of Friday, Lula waited in hope that the country's top appeals court, the Superior Tribunal of Justice, would temporarily suspend his arrest warrant. However, the petition was rejected shortly before the deadline expired.Yet another appeal for an injunction against the arrest was filed late Friday with the Supreme Court.On Thursday, Moro had given Lula 24 hours to surrender voluntarily to police and begin incarceration in the southern city of Curitiba. Moro said the cell, a separate room with its own toilet, was ready, and that Lula would not be handcuffed -- if he came quietly.- Loved on the left -Lula was convicted last year of taking a luxury apartment as a kickback from a big construction company. He lost a lower court appeal in January and saw his sentence increased from nine to 12 years.To his Workers' Party faithful, Lula is a victim of an out-of-control judiciary preventing him from returning to power.They remember him for a 2003-2010 presidency that saw tens of millions lifted from poverty and Brazil rise on the world stage.""Lula is innocent, Lula for president!"" supporters chanted outside the union building.Renata Swiecik, an unemployed mother of four who had joined the crowd, urged Lula not to hand himself over.""We are here to resist to the end. Lula will not be a prisoner in 2018, he'll be president and help the people once more,"" said Swiecik, 31.- Corruption taint -However, Lula's imminent arrest is being celebrated by many Brazilians.The ""Car Wash"" probe, which has revealed systemic, high-level embezzlement and bribery throughout business and politics over the last four years, is wildly popular.Detractors say that Lula epitomizes Brazil's corruption-riddled elite and his conviction is the biggest ""Car Wash"" scalp by far.""I want Lula in prison, I want a better future and with him in the leadership we won't have that,"" said Maura Moraes de Oliveira, 51, who works as a maid in Curitiba.""Not only Lula should be locked up, but all the corrupt, a complete cleaning.""Operation ""Car Wash"" was named after the service station where agents initially investigated a minor money laundering scheme in 2014, before realizing that they'd stumbled on a gargantuan web of embezzlement and bribery at state oil company Petrobras and right through the political classes.Lula, who grew up poor and with little formal education before becoming a trade union leader and politician, has long said he will go down fighting.In theory, once someone has been convicted and lost a lower court appeal, he or she is barred from running for office under Brazil's clean-slate law.Still, even in prison, Lula has the right to register as a candidate. It would then be up to the Superior Electoral Tribunal to rule on whether his candidacy could stand.Although Lula would almost certainly be blocked, he could use the process to maintain his political influence."
b'Is America&apos;s Greatest Fear Coming True? Is a Russia-China Alliance Forming?',https://www.yahoo.com/news/america-apos-greatest-fear-coming-002900222.html,"Dave MajumdarSecurity, Is America's Greatest Fear Coming True? Is a Russia-China Alliance Forming?Russia and China are drawing closer together as Washington ratchets up pressure on Moscow and Beijing.In recent months, the United States has enacted sanctions against Moscow and has imposed a series of trade tariffs on Beijing, antagonizing both great powers simultaneously. As result of American pressure, the two powers—which already had grievances against Washington—have formed a strategic partnership to balance against the U.S-led liberal hegemony.""I am visiting Russia as a new defense minister of China to show the world a high level of development of our bilateral relations and firm determination of our Armed Forces to strengthen strategic cooperation,"" People’s Liberation Army Gen. Wei Fenghe, China’s minister of national defense, said at the Moscow International Security Conference according to the Russian TASS new agency.Recommended: The 5 Biggest Nuclear Bomb Tests (From All 6 Nuclear Powers).Recommended: How Israel Takes U.S. Weapons and Makes Them Better.Recommended: North Korea’s Most Lethal Weapon Isn’t Nukes.Wei explicitly told the conference attendees that he was there to demonstrate to Washington that China is there to support Russia in their common struggle against an American dominated liberal international world order.""Second, to support the Russian side in organizing the Moscow International Security Conference the Chinese side has come to show Americans the close ties between the Armed Forces of China and Russia, especially in this situation. We’ve come to support you,” Wei said. “The Chinese side is ready to express with the Russian side our common concerns and common position on important international problems at international venues as well.""The Russian side also praised the new level of cooperation reached between Beijing and Moscow.“The efforts of the leadership of the both countries, Russian-Chinese relations today has reached principally new unprecedented level, and have become a critical factor in keeping peace and international security” Russian defense minister Gen. Sergei Shoigu said.As Carnegie Moscow scholar Dmitri Trenin wrote in his book Should We Fear Russia?, Russia and China are wary of each other, but abhor American dominance of the international order.“Each country is wary of coming too close to the other. China and Russia, however, can continue to consolidate and upgrade their relationship short of an alliance,” Trenin wrote. “In this case, more of Russia’s natural and military-technological resources would be made available to China. Strategic coordination between Moscow and Beijing would remain loose, but, in the larger scheme of things concerning the world order, Beijing and Moscow will be on the same side.”The goal of the Russian-Chinese entente would be to limit American dominance across the globe.“The Greater Eurasia that they are constructing will not be run from a single center, but their continental entente will essentially be aimed at limiting US dominance on the edges of the continent and in the world at large,” Trenin wrote.Thus far, Washington’s own actions have fueled closer cooperation between the two Eurasian titans. As Russia grows more isolated from the West, the Sino-Russian alliance will only grow closer.Dave Majumdar is the defense editor for The National Interest.

b'US seizes pot-growing houses tied to China-based criminals',https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-seizes-pot-growing-houses-191400069.html,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Hundreds of federal and local law enforcement agents have seized roughly 100 Northern California houses purchased with money wired to the United States by a Chinese-based crime organization and used to grow massive amounts of marijuana illegally, authorities said Wednesday.The raids culminated a monthslong investigation focusing on dozens of Chinese nationals who bought homes in seven counties. Most of the buyers were in the country legally and were not arrested as authorities investigate if they were indebted to the gang and forced into the work, U.S. Attorney McGregor Scott said.Much of the pot was shipped to Georgia, Illinois, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania through Atlanta, Chicago and New York City, he said. The drug is legal in California but requires permits to grow and can't be sent across state lines. It is still banned by the U.S. government.Black-market pot-growing houses have proliferated in the inland California region where authorities carried out the raids, and many of them were traced to Chinese criminal organizations from the San Francisco Bay Area in the mid-2000s, Scott said. The high number of grow houses in the area may be because of low property prices compared with the Bay Area and the state's large Chinese population, the prosecutor said.Scott called the recent crackdown ""a game-changer"" that may have cost the criminal organization ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" in lost drug profits and the money it spent on the homes.""It hits the criminals right where it counts — in the pocketbook,"" he said.Authorities tracked at least 125 wire transfers totaling $6.3 million from Fujian Province in China, all just below the $50,000 limit imposed by the Chinese government.Officials are trying to learn if the homebuyers are what Scott called ""indentured servants"" — indebted to the Chinese gang and brought to the United States to buy and tend the grow houses. Many speak only Mandarin Chinese.""We're treating them as victims"" who may have been ""forced or coerced"" to work in what can be toxic environments, FBI Special Agent in Charge Sean Ragan said.The buyers generally used the same Sacramento real estate agents, borrowed from private lenders instead of traditional banks, and used straw buyers who purchased the properties on behalf of the real owners.The U.S. crackdown comes as California is months into creating the world's largest legal marijuana market amid uncertainty about whether the U.S. government will try to shut it down.More than 500 officers, including SWAT teams, fanned out over two days to search and seize 81 houses and two real estate businesses. Another 25 houses were raided previously.They seized more than 61,000 marijuana plants, 200 kilograms (440 pounds) of processed marijuana, at least $100,000 in cash and 15 firearms, including one that had been stolen.The U.S. Department of Justice said it was one of the largest residential forfeiture operations ever. Prosecutors will now ask judges to transfer ownership of the houses to the U.S. government to resell while they track the enterprise back to its roots, Scott said.Most of the suburban houses were valued at $300,000 to $700,000, though some were in rural areas and some in more upscale neighborhoods.U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that transnational criminal organizations are ""a blight on our communities, bringing dangerous drugs to our streets and trying to impose a false sovereignty over our neighborhoods.""The Chinese consulate general's office in San Francisco did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Illegal grow houses have been a widespread problem in Northern California for at least a dozen years. Sacramento officials have estimated that there might be as many as 1,000 illegal grow houses in California's capital city.Authorities previously said the practice of growing marijuana in homes instead of outdoors originated along Canada's West Coast and migrated south as border restrictions increased after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.Suburban tract homes get transformed with high intensity lights and irrigation pipes, gutted to add ventilation pipes and air filtration systems to vent the tell-tale smell, and stacked with tables full of marijuana plants that could produce multiple crops each year.""It's like industrial agriculture,"" Scott said."
