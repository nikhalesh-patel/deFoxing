b'How Did Ohio Get So Extreme on Abortion?',https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/04/ohio-has-become-the-conservative-vanguard-for-opposing-abortion-rights.html,"                  Last week, the Trump administration announced plans to add a new question to the U.S. census. In 2020, the nationwide survey will ask people to mark down whether they are citizens—a seemingly minor change that will have far-reaching implications on legislative redistricting and, thus, U.S. politics and policy for years to come. For one glimpse of the ripple effect of redistricting on everyday life, look to Ohio, where legislators have passed a host of restrictive policies on abortion in defiance of voters’ actual views on the subject.                          The state is generally regarded as politically purple, a proverbial toss-up in presidential elections. Donald Trump’s 8-point margin of victory in 2016 was the widest in nearly three decades. Before Trump, Barack Obama won the state twice, and George W. Bush won it twice before that.                          But at the state level, Ohio has emerged as a conservative force on the issue of reproductive rights, putting itself at the vanguard of extreme anti-abortion legislation. In late 2016, the state Legislature passed what’s known as a “heartbeat bill”—a ban on all abortions performed after six weeks’ gestation, before many women even know they’re pregnant. If Gov. John Kasich hadn’t vetoed it in favor of a 20-week ban, it would have been the most extreme abortion restriction in the country. Earlier this month, a federal judge blocked an Ohio law that would have subjected doctors to felony charges if they perform an abortion sought because the fetus has a high probability of being born with Down syndrome. Ohio restrictions on medication abortions passed in 2011 have resulted in more doctor’s visits, more side effects, and greater need for medical intervention for women who choose this otherwise very safe route. And according to a 2013 law, a woman who wants an abortion in the state must submit to an ultrasound. If the ultrasound detects fetal pole cardiac activity, her doctor must ask if she’d like to listen to it or see the image.                          Now, the Ohio state Legislature is considering a law that would require abortion clinics to give fetal tissue a formal burial or cremation. The bill mirrors those previously passed in Indiana and Texas, both of which were later blocked in court. Twenty legislators have also signed on to a total abortion ban, without even an exception to save the life of the pregnant woman. If passed and signed by the governor, women who get abortions and doctors who perform them could be charged with aggravated homicide, a capital offense. Few people in the modern anti-abortion movement are willing to argue that women should be put to death for getting abortion care. Twenty of them are serving today in the Ohio state Legislature.                          There’s little evidence that Ohio voters as a whole hold such deeply held views against abortion. Obama captured the state twice, running as a proudly pro-choice candidate, while Bush also won twice running against a woman’s right to choose. The state elected a pro-choice U.S. senator, Sherrod Brown, in 2006, and an anti-choice U.S. senator, Rob Portman, in 2010, then re-elected Brown in 2012 and Portman in 2016. According to a 2014 Pew survey, Ohio voters are evenly split in their views of abortion rights, and 63 percent of Ohioans polled in 2015 said they’d be less likely to support a presidential candidate who wanted to ban all abortions. The same poll found that voters in the state opposed by a 14-point margin the recently passed law banning abortions related to Down syndrome.                          So, how did Ohio become home to some of the country’s most extreme anti-choice legislation? The answer seems to be a combination of partisan engineering and a one-woman wrecking ball who has forced vulnerable Republican legislators to heel on the issue.                          When I put the question to Kellie Copeland, the executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio, she gave a rueful laugh and responded with one word: “gerrymandering.” Republicans currently hold supermajorities in both chambers, with about three-fifths of state lawmakers identifying as anti-choice. “The people in the Legislature, for the most part, they don’t look like the population, they don’t think like the population,” Copeland said. “The gerrymandering has been so bad in Ohio that I think it’s actually disenfranchised voters, because the politicians have picked their constituents instead of the other way around.” Even people in Ohio who oppose abortion rights don’t usually support full-on bans, she continued, especially without exceptions for rape, incest, and the health of the pregnant person. Their elected representatives, on the other hand, do.                          This legislative session, both chambers comprise the largest one-party majorities in the state’s history. Republicans hold 24 seats in the 33-seat Senate and 66 in the 99-member House. The party first claimed a supermajority in 2012, but the bigger shift came in 2010, when the Democrats lost a whopping 13 seats in the House, handing control of the chamber to Republicans in the crucial election before the state maps would be redrawn. Anti-gerrymandering advocates place much of the blame for this power shift on REDMAP, a wildly effective Republican strategy that flipped a number of statehouses from blue to red ahead of the 2011 redistricting process by launching dark-money campaigns against no-name state legislators or those who’d assumed their seats were safe. When it came time to set the new Ohio state legislative districts in 2011, the Republicans were in control, and they drew the map to their liking.                          According to a Dayton Daily News analysis, there were only 20 competitive state House districts out of 99 in the new 2011 map, and only seven competitive state Senate districts out of 33. The one Democrat on the board responsible for drawing the map said at the time that it “quarantined” Democrats into just one-third of the state legislative districts despite the fact that those voters made up around half the state’s population. (The state’s congressional map includes a gerrymandered district so famous it now has a name: the Snake on the Lake, which runs from Cleveland to Toledo on the shore of Lake Erie. In one spot, two portions of the district are connected only by a bridge over the water.)                          “A natural consequence of really safe elections is … our state reps and our state senators only really have to worry about the primaries,” said Catherine Turcer, the executive director of Common Cause Ohio, an advocacy group that works on redistricting reform. “And if they only have to worry about the primary, they’re much more likely to go to the extremes, because they can easily be primaried on the left or primaried on the right. It leads to extreme dysfunction.” Turcer said Republican legislators in Ohio, safe in red districts and trying to fend off further-right primary challengers, have become preoccupied with pro-gun and anti-abortion legislation while neglecting important issues that better lend themselves to bipartisan solutions, such as improving schools and addressing Ohio’s infant mortality rate, one of the 10 worst in the nation.                          Conservative activists have been eager to exploit that dynamic. The most conspicuous has been Janet Porter, a prominent right-wing activist who runs Faith2Action, an organization that has been so aggressive in its crusade that the Southern Poverty Law Center has labeled it a hate group. Porter was dubbed “the architect of the ‘gay conversion’ campaign” by the New York Times in 1998 (she was Janet Folger at the time), and she was in the national spotlight again last year, when she defended Senate candidate and accused child molester Roy Moore on CNN by congratulating pregnant anchor Poppy Harlow on her “unborn child.” Moore would “stand for the rights of babies like yours in the womb,” Porter said, “where his opponent will support killing them until the moment of birth.”                          In Ohio, Porter pushed for the state to become the first to ban the procedure anti-abortion activists call “partial-birth abortion.” She also wrote and aggressively lobbied for the “heartbeat bill” that kept popping up in the Ohio Legislature for years before making it to the governor’s desk in 2016. (Last year, she convinced Rep. Steve King of Iowa to introduce the same legislation in Congress.) Kasich’s veto of the “heartbeat bill” seemed to allay fears about a total abortion ban in the state, but Copeland, the Ohio NARAL director, cautions against dismissing the proposal as an impossibility. She believes lobbying from NARAL and other reproductive rights advocacy groups helped convince Kasich that signing the six-week abortion ban would have been bad for his future career.                          But Kasich’s term is up in January, and a pitched primary for the Republican nomination to replace him has seen both front-runners moving further to the right. Ohio Attorney General Mike Dewine has been a vocal fan of Jeff Sessions, and Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor backed the successful bid of a far-right Trump supporter, Jane Timken, to replace the more moderate chairman of the state Republican Party. Both candidates appear to be battling over who can be the least accommodating of abortion rights. Taylor has already said she would have signed the six-week abortion ban; Dewine recently signed an amicus brief supporting the Trump administration’s efforts to force undocumented teenagers to carry unwanted pregnancies to term. “Some people aren’t taking this [total abortion ban] bill that seriously,” Copeland told me. “But when you look at it through that lens, I don’t know how you can’t.”                          And even if the next Ohio governor thinks it politically imprudent to sign a complete abortion ban, the Republican Party could still pass it with its veto-proof majorities in the Legislature.                          Those majorities appear to be safe, for now. The League of Women Voters of Ohio found that only two of the 99 state House races turned out differently than the political index predicted in the 2012 race, and only three did so in 2014. In 2014, House Republicans got 57 percent of the total votes in the state but won 66 percent of the seats in the House. That 9-point vote-to-seat gap increased to 10 points in the 2016 election. An Associated Press report estimated that the map, as drawn, gave Republicans five more state House seats than they would have gotten with a neutrally drawn map. A 2014 report from University of Chicago law scholars named Ohio’s state legislative map as one of the worst in the country, an example of “uncommonly severe gerrymandering.” “The mapmakers, in many ways, have had more say in who gets elected than the voters in Ohio,” said Catherine Turcer of Common Cause Ohio.                          That may change after the 2020 census, when new districts will be drawn. Turcer is currently traveling the state to gin up support for the Fair Districts = Fair Elections amendment, a redistricting reform measure that would require support from three-fifths of the entire Legislature, including 50 percent of the minority party, to certify a district map for the full 10 years. (Otherwise, it would expire after four.) In a rare feat of bipartisanship, the Ohio state Legislature approved the measure with near-unanimity, and voters will determine its fate on their primary ballots in May. In 2015, voters approved the reform initiative for state legislative redistricting; the new ballot measure will apply the same standards to congressional redistricting.                          The 2015 ballot initiative was a monster success for Turcer and her peers—Ohioans approved the measure in all 88 counties, with 71.5 percent voting in favor overall. Turcer says she’s cautiously optimistic about the May vote, which, with its impact on congressional seats, will have national implications. “I’m hopeful, because no matter what, we are a purple state. And if we all vote as a whole on something, we look for bipartisan, reasonable solutions,” she said. “We’re tired of one party marginalizing the other. We’d like to participate in real elections.”        Since Donald Trump entered the White House, Slate has stepped up our politics coverage—bringing you news and opinion from writers like Jamelle Bouie and Dahlia Lithwick.

b'The Vanishing Republican Agenda',https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/04/republicans-are-surprisingly-content-with-trumps-accomplishments.html,"                  Congress will be in recess for the next week or so, and we’ve been given a few peeks recently about what Republicans will set about doing once they get back. According to Politico, one of the items on the agenda may be tax cuts. Yes. Really.        Republicans are dreaming of passing another round of tax cuts this year—or at least making vulnerable Democrats squirm by voting against them.GOP leaders are weighing a series of votes to make last year’s temporary tax cuts for individuals permanent, according to Republicans in both chambers. The strategy would portray the party as the guardian of Americans’ paychecks, Republicans say, and buoy the GOP during a brutal election year.                   They may also pretend to go after a balanced-budget amendment. According to the Washington Post’s Jeff Stein, this was a promise made by Paul Ryan to House fiscal conservatives as a condition of their support for December’s deficit-exploding tax bill. It is also a move likely aimed in part at placating whatever Republican constituents sincerely and deeply troubled by America’s fiscal situation might still be out there. Passage and enactment would require the support of Democrats in the Senate and three-fourths of America’s state legislatures; Republicans will get neither.                          In sum, much of what the party does legislatively this year will be pure theater. Whether or not Democrats take the House in November, there is no chance whatsoever that the GOP will have more votes to pass major legislation afterward than they do now. It may well be some time before the right will have another real shot at, for instance, slashing entitlements. That project has been the boyhood dream of House Speaker Paul Ryan, who was rumored to be on the cusp of retirement last week. Those rumors were quickly shot down, but it wasn’t the first time the subject has come up. A Politico profile in December reported that Ryan had “his eyes on the exits.” The plan, according to Politico’s Tim Alberta and Rachel Bade, would be for Ryan to retire after the midterm elections, giving the speaker “a final legislative year to chase his second white whale, entitlement reform, while using his unrivaled fundraising prowess to help protect the House majority—all with the benefit of averting an ugly internecine power struggle during election season.”                   But it’s precisely elections that make it unlikely Republicans will throw themselves into a push for cuts sure to be deeply unpopular before November. Ryan and the party are in a real strategic bind. And yet establishment conservatives are generally sunny about what Republicans have been able to do.                          Earlier this year, the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, released a report praising the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress for implementing 64 percent of the recommendations advanced in their “Mandate for Leadership” platform—a significant increase from the 49 percent of Heritage recommendations that Ronald Reagan had completed at the same point in his presidency. That list of 334 recommendations includes a few big-ticket items that the administration’s gotten done, like a tax bill as well as a dizzying array of executive actions. The foundation does, though, seem to be grading on a bit of a curve. Its checklist, for instance, credits the Trump administration for “adopting” their recommendation to repeal and replace Obamacare, which has, obviously, not been repealed nor replaced. The tax bill did kill the individual mandate, but the Republican effort to pass a comprehensive health care bill failed spectacularly and it’s not at all clear that Congress will take another swing at ditching the rest of the ACA anytime soon.                          As Mike Konczal of the Roosevelt Institute pointed out on Tuesday, Republicans seem strangely uninterested in strategically evaluating what happened on that front or how the party has spent its political capital, broadly speaking:        Is anyone on the Right really trying to figure out what went wrong in a public venue? When the public option failed in 2010 left media covered the ins-and-outs of it in great detail. Joe Lieberman is not in good standing with liberals for his refusal to support a Medicare buy-in at 55, which is what he previously endorsed. Do conservatives blame John McCain for killing the “skinny repeal” in a last-minute thumbs down vote just as much? Did they even like skinny repeal?                  What we see instead are establishment conservatives like National Review editor Rich Lowry encouraging Republicans to stay rosy about what Trump and Republicans in Congress have accomplished. “For much of the year, Trump’s presidency had seemed to be sound and fury signifying not much besides the welcome ascension of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court,” he wrote in December. “Now, it is sound and fury signifying a discernible shift of American government to the right.”                          This is both inarguably true and a fairly low bar for a Republican president to clear. This sunniness, moreover, combined with the GOP’s potential return in a matter of weeks to tax cuts and deficit trolling suggests that the Republican Party does not, actually, have very many ideas about how to solve the problems facing this country. Taken seriously, the notion that we’ve just witnessed, in the past year, conservatives accomplishing over 60 percent of what they wanted to do with this administration is indicative of a profound disconnect. It is doubtful that the average American would say that 60 percent of what ought to be fixed in this country has just been repaired.                          The average Republican voter might, though, and perhaps that’s all that matters on the right. Polling last year showed that Republican opinion on the economic situation improved dramatically soon after the election and well before the passage of any legislation that might have significantly impacted it. Clearly, the party’s faithful are guided less by policy success than by other more ineffable forces—the opportunity, for instance, that sending Republicans to Washington offers them for the expression of certain cultural grievances. On that front, obviously, Republican governance has already been a phenomenal success.

b'The Kids vs. the King',https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/04/can-parkland-activists-help-democrat-j-d-scholten-defeat-iowa-rep-steve-king.html,"                  Most Republican officials have steered clear of directly criticizing the teenage survivors of the Parkland shooting, but Rep. Steve King has never been one for such caution. One day after 18-year-old Emma González led a tearful, silent tribute to her slain classmates during a march in Washington, King’s campaign shared a conservative meme on its Facebook page mocking González. It was a nonsensical attack—focused on the fact that González, who is of Cuban heritage, was wearing a jacket with a Cuban flag—but it was sufficient to make King the newest enemy of a burgeoning gun control movement. When King followed his Facebook post with a Twitter taunt about the teenagers’ demand to raise the age for purchasing some firearms to 21, the activists struck back.                          “We’re gonna vote you out, Steve,” wrote Jaclyn Corin, a Parkland student and one of the organizers of last month’s march, in a tweet that drew more than 20,000 retweets and more than 120,000 likes. David Hogg, who has become a face of the #NeverAgain movement, created a new hashtag, #votesteveout, and before long, the young Parkland students were urging their supporters to show up at King’s campaign events and promising to defeat him this fall.                          But ousting King is easier said than done. Despite a history of outlandish comments, the Democratic establishment has mostly given up on defeating the eight-term Iowa congressman, after he easily survived a party-backed challenge in 2012. To do it this year, the Parkland activists and their celebrity supporters are placing their hopes in a 38-year-old first-time candidate and former minor league baseball player named J.D. Scholten. “Help us @Scholten4Iowa… you’re our only hope!” tweeted Mark Hamill, who dubbed him #JDtheJedi.        No more noble mission than to FORCE the odious @SteveKingIA back to the private sector. Help us @Scholten4Iowa... you're our only hope!#JDtheJedi #VanquishTheKing https://t.co/GiNyRNlyXg                  “I’ll admit, that was pretty cool,” said Scholten, in a recent interview about the surge of support. A week earlier, Scholten had been a mild favorite among three relatively unheralded Democratic challengers vying to challenge King. Now, he’s the clear front-runner for the nomination, and a national cause célèbre, in a race that had previously been well under the radar.                          King has a long history of making incendiary, and often racist, remarks that prompt national outrage, but they have yet to cost him politically back home . He’s suggested that government-funded birth control could lead to a “dying civilization” and that Planned Parenthood was using federal funds to provide “robo-Skype abortions.” He’s claimed no “subgroup of people” has contributed more to civilization than white Christians and declared, “We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies.” And most infamously, in 2013, King said that for every Dreamer who becomes “a valedictorian, there’s another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds—and they’ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they’ve been hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.” King never faced any serious backlash over that from his own party, and he went on to win his seventh term in 2014 by a margin of 23 points. The following year, a majority of the Republicans running for president—including Donald Trump—made the pilgrimage to King’s inaugural Iowa Freedom Fest to pay their respects.                          King’s closest race to date came in 2012, when Democrats recruited Christie Vilsack, the wife of popular former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, and threw more than $1 million in outside money behind her campaign. Vilsack focused on parochial issues like a federal farm bill, and the race was considered a toss-up a month before Election Day. In the end, King coasted to an easy 8-point victory. This year, King will face a challenger with far less experience and far fewer connections than Vilsack had. Scholten has spent most of his professional life toiling in the minor leagues and working as a paralegal, with little prior connection to Iowa politics. Nonpartisan handicappers like the Cook Political Report haven’t put much stock in Scholten or the rest of this year’s Democratic field, rating King’s seat as the only “safe” Republican-held seat in Iowa this fall.                          For Scholten, the gun control cause could be an awkward fit for the district, which covers the northwest swath of the state and is Iowa’s largest and most rural. It is the only one of the state’s four districts that does not include a city with at least 100,000 people. Instead, it consists mostly of rural farm area dotted with the occasional town or small city. It went for Trump by 27 points less than two years ago and, at the start of this one, had roughly 73,000 more registered Republicans than Democrats among its roughly half-million voters.                          But Scholten said he had no choice but to make gun safety one of his top campaign issues after what happened in Parkland. “This is something that has happened nationally—to do nothing is not an option,” he said in an interview. “We have to have a discussion about this.” He believes that discussion should start with the obvious answers and then expand from there. “One of the most frustrating things, and one of things that provoked me into running,” he said, “is that 97 percent of Americans want universal background checks—how come we can’t get something passed?”                          Gun control, naturally, is not the only place Scholten and King disagree. Scholten supports a $15 minimum wage, an incremental move toward universal health care, comprehensive immigration reform that would protect Dreamers, and a woman’s right to choose. It can be difficult to place first-time candidates on the political spectrum, but Scholten appears somewhere to the left of a moderate like Conor Lamb, who pulled off a special-election upset in Pennsylvania this month, and somewhere to the right of someone like Pete D’Alessandro, the Bernie Sanders disciple running in the Iowa district to the south of King’s. Like Lamb, Scholten said he doesn’t want to see Nancy Pelosi remain as the Democratic leader. (“Democrats hate trickle-down economics; they should hate trickle-down politics.”) Unlike Lamb, he doesn’t use a personally against hedge when talking about abortion. (“I’m a guy, it’s not my body; it’s a woman’s right to choose.”)                          That’s not the type of platform that has traditionally played well in northwestern Iowa, where anti-abortion signs are a common roadside sight. But liberals hope King’s latest taunts will be new motivation for an energized left—fueled by the anti-Trump resistance—and the media-savvy Parkland activists, who have proven capable of scoring victories against proudly un-PC conservatives who have traditionally been immune to shame. “This isn’t the first time Steve King has done something like this,” Scholten said. (King’s office did not respond to a request for an interview.)                          While he’s seen an uptick in donations and volunteer sign-ups in the past week, Scholten said it’s difficult to distinguish any Parkland bump from the end-of-quarter fundraising blitz that was already underway. He out-raised King in the final quarter of 2017 by a 2-to-1 margin, bringing in donations from all 50 states, and he began the year with about $80,000 more on hand than his rival did.                          The Parkland exposure could help, if it holds, but Scholten said past brushes with celebrities haven’t always been the financial boon he might expect. “Fundraising is a very, very bizarre thing,” he said. “When we first launched, Judd Apatow retweeted something of ours, and I was so excited because I am a huge fan of his. But we didn’t get one dollar from it.”        Since Donald Trump entered the White House, Slate has stepped up our politics coverage—bringing you news and opinion from writers like Jamelle Bouie and Dahlia Lithwick.

b'What the President Won\xe2\x80\x99t Say',https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/03/donald-trump-refuses-to-speak-out-against-racial-violence.html,"                  Donald Trump has been president for 14 months, and in that time, he has commented on virtually everything under the sun, from able news personalities and political rivals to professional football players and prominent black celebrities. Trump is so vocal about what he likes and dislikes—so present in the national conversation—that his omissions are often more revealing than his comments. On the rare occasions when this president is silent, it is consistently when confronted with violence against nonwhites.                          On Thursday, reporters asked White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders for comment on the shooting of Stephon Clark, an unarmed black man who was killed by the Sacramento, California, police while standing in his grandmother’s backyard. According to a private autopsy, Clark was shot eight times in the back by police who claimed to have seen a gun. He was holding a phone. “Certainly a terrible incident,” said Sanders, before adding that “this is something that is a local matter and that’s something that we feel should be left up to the local authorities at this point in time.”                          Asked for further clarification, Sanders doubled down. “Certainly, we want to make sure that all law enforcement is carrying out the letter of the law. The president is very supportive of law enforcement, but at the same time in these specific cases and these specific instances, those will be left up to the local authorities,” she said.                          Trump’s silence around incidents of racial violence, and police violence in particular, is unusual for a president. Barack Obama regularly commented on the killings of unarmed black Americans, from Trayvon Martin during his first term to Alton Sterling and Philando Castile in his second. “[The shootings] are symptomatic of the broader challenges within our criminal justice system, the racial disparities that appear across the system year after year, and the resulting lack of trust that exists between law enforcement and too many of the communities they serve,” said Obama during extended remarks at a press conference in Warsaw, Poland, in 2016.                          Obama’s predecessor, George W. Bush, took time to address outrage over the Jena Six, a group of six black teenagers arrested for the assault of a white classmate in Jena, Louisiana. The beating followed multiple racially charged incidents, including the hanging of nooses from a tree. Critics believed that local prosecutors had been overzealous—and racially discriminatory—in charging them with attempted murder. Protesters, likewise, saw their treatment as part of a pattern of racial unfairness. Given the national controversy and outrage, President Bush felt obliged to speak. “I understand the emotions,” the president said. “The Justice Department and the FBI are monitoring the situation down there and all of us in America want there to be fairness when it comes to justice.”                          Bill Clinton spoke out on the shooting death of Amadou Diallo by New York City police. “I didn’t sit there and listen to the evidence, but I know most people in America of all races believe that if it had been a young white man in a young all-white neighborhood, it probably wouldn’t have happened,” said Clinton. “That doesn’t mean they were guilty under criminal law and the Justice Department is looking into that, in the Civil Rights Division, and that’s the way to handle that. But what it does mean is there’s this huge gulf out there still, in too many places, where people wonder if they can be treated fairly.”                          Even George H.W. Bush commented on the major incident of his presidency, the 1991 Rodney King beating. “Civil rights leaders and just plain citizens fearful of and sometimes victimized by police brutality were deeply hurt,” said Bush in an address after the involved officers were acquitted. “And I know good and decent policemen who were equally appalled.”                          Far from “local matters” that don’t rise to presidential attention, police shootings like the one that killed Clark are obviously of national concern. Presidents speak to them—and other racial incidents—because race and racism are critical parts of American life, and addressing them is an important part of representing the country as a whole.                          But this assumes that Donald Trump seeks to represent all Americans. Among other things, his attacks on immigrants, disparaging language for migrants, overt disrespect for prominent black Americans, and deliberate neglect of Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria say otherwise. In both word and deed, President Trump has announced who he intends to serve and represent while in the White House. Americans like Stephon Clark, unfortunately, aren’t part of that group.

b'Chaos Awaits Ronny Jackson at the VA',https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/03/white-house-doctor-ronny-jackson-to-lead-va-amid-chaos-in-veterans-affairs.html,"                  In the 88 years since the founding of the modern Department of Veterans Affairs, presidents have mostly turned to retired military officers and politicos to run the massive agency. Most have failed. The agency’s size, complexities, and politics have flummoxed even the most capable of leaders.                          Enter Ronny Jackson—a Navy doctor who saw combat in Iraq and went on to serve as White House physician, caring for three presidents including President Donald Trump. Jackson is now being nominated to replace David Shulkin at the helm of the government’s second-largest agency. Jackson’s impressive military medical record, and bipartisan support, will likely smooth the path for a relatively quick confirmation. But after that, a swamp of policy, political, and cultural fights awaits him at the VA.                          The VA’s policy fights owe much to its size and complexity. The agency runs a portfolio that includes physical and mental health care, disability compensation, education benefits, home loan guarantees, life insurance, burials, and much more, consuming nearly $200 billion a year and requiring more than 340,000 employees. Most of the VA will be new to Jackson, whose professional life has existed within the relatively insular military.                          At the VA, the biggest policy fight has to do with the future of VA health care, and the extent to which the government will purchase this care from the private sector or deliver it through the VA’s huge network of hospitals and clinics. Disagreement with the White House on this policy issue doomed Shulkin, and it is where Trump’s allies may expect the most deference from Jackson, given his relative lack of VA or private health care experience. But even if he concedes  to the White House, there are no easy policy choices here, as two major assessments and commissions since 2014 found, and fewer safe political options. It doesn’t help that the VA has become embroiled in the broader conservative battle to shrink government and remove it from the health care marketplace altogether.                          If health care were the only issue facing the VA now, Jackson could concentrate on one heavy lift. But if he takes over for Shulkin, he will inherit policy conundrums in nearly every part of the VA portfolio. On disability, for example, Jackson must answer tough questions about how to update the VA’s aging system for disability ratings and payments. On education benefits, he and the VA must better guard veterans from predatory behavior by for-profit schools. The VA is also crumbling under its own weight in many areas. Jackson will need to figure out how to shed aging infrastructure, update the VA’s electronic health record, and more. Solving these problems is easier said than done—and far more politicized than anything Jackson touched in the military.                          These are hard policy questions; they are made more difficult by political conflicts within the Trump administration, disagreements between the administration and Congress, and tensions across the broader veteran community as well. Shulkin battled daily with Trump’s partisans; their relations deteriorated so badly that Shulkin reportedly barred several appointees’ access to the VA’s executive suite, and the White House barred Shulkin’s access to the press. Neither the White House nor Congress nor leading veterans organizations agree on how to resolve any of the policy dilemmas facing the VA. Jackson will walk into this crossfire—and do so during a contentious midterm election year.                          Looming over these policy and political fights are deeper cultural questions about the future of the VA and its role serving veterans. There are huge demographic, social, economic, and political shifts underway within America’s veteran community as the conscription-driven cohorts of World War II, Korea, and Vietnam fade away and are replaced in smaller numbers by the all-volunteer cohorts of the past 45 years. These shifts have triggered debates  about what, exactly, ought to be America’s social contract with those who have served. In concrete terms, the issues require figuring out which veterans get benefits, and precisely how much. Should the agency be small and focused just on disabled veterans who served in combat or who were injured in the line of duty—or large and focused on helping all veterans? Should the agency merely compensate veterans for injuries or illnesses sustained during service—or do more to help them thrive, such that their success is an incentive for military recruiting? Jackson will soon find himself at ground zero for these emotional and political arguments.                          With his prestigious record and experience, Jackson has the raw material to understand the mission of the VA and learn how to be a good secretary. But he will be sailing into stormy waters that have only become more turbulent during the Trump presidency. What gets lost in the revolving door is that continuity of leadership is critical for leading large federal agencies like the VA. Budgets and programs live on cycles that last longer than the average Cabinet official’s tenure. Successful change requires years to implement. If the president truly cares about serving veterans, and making the VA better, he will give Dr. Jackson a longer period to prove himself than he gave Dr. Shulkin, and stick with him even when they disagree.

"b'Paul Ryan Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t Retired Yet, but the Battle to Replace Him Has Begun'",https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/03/steve-scalise-positions-himself-amid-paul-ryan-retirement-rumors.html,"                  In the latest development of the House Speaker Paul Ryan Is Definitely Not Considering Retirement saga, we have a leading candidate to replace Ryan, Majority Whip Steve Scalise, speaking on the record about how he’s interested in the top job.                          “In an interview Tuesday in Louisiana’s southern-most port,” Politico writes, “Scalise acknowledged his desire to lead the conference someday but said now isn’t the time to discuss it.” But what the hell? He discussed it a little bit anyway.                          “Obviously, I’ve shown interest in the past at moving up,” Scalise said. “I’ve enjoyed … leadership.” And, for good measure, he made sure to note a qualification he can run on: “I feel like I’ve had a strong influence on some of the things that we’ve done, and I’ve helped put together coalitions to pass a full repeal of Obamacare.”                          But again, all very hypothetical.                          The Ryan retirement rumors first burst into the open in December when HuffPost and Politico published stories about when the speaker would be out the door—something that, were Ryan considering it, he wouldn’t muse openly about for a variety of reasons. Despite his denials, the rumors have persisted, though predictions about how Ryan might bounce once tax reform cleared the chamber obviously didn’t pan out.                          The whispers surfaced again earlier this week when Nevada Rep. Mark Amodei, bless his heart, said in an interview that “the rumor mill is that Paul Ryan is getting ready to resign in the next 30 to 60 days and that Steve Scalise will be the new speaker.” Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks, who long ago stopped caring about potential consequences for opening his mouth, told a radio station this week that “every indication is that Paul Ryan is not going to run for re-election.”                          Brooks noted that the chatter about Ryan’s replacement is “primarily focused” on Scalise for two reasons: his “heroic” standing after being shot at a congressional baseball practice last year, and the fact he’s more conservative than the current No. 2, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy. When Scalise was elevated to leadership, after all, he was brought on as a sort of liaison between leaders and the conservative wing of the party.                          “Scalise’s allies” tell Politico that if Ryan left and McCarthy wanted the job, Scalise wouldn’t challenge him. But that’s not as magnanimous as it seems. McCarthy dropped out of the race to replace John Boehner in 2015 when a series of issues—his comments about the House Benghazi investigation, his relative lack of conservatism, rumors of infidelity—made it clear that he would struggle to get 218 Republican votes. It is unlikely that McCarthy, over the past three years, has become acceptably conservative to the Freedom Caucus.                          Politico writes that Scalise would “make a move, however, only if [McCarthy] were not to run or fell short.” And who’s to know for sure whether McCarthy wouldn’t have the votes? Perhaps the current House majority whip.

b'Donald Trump Has Little to Fear From the FEC',https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/03/donald-trump-has-little-to-fear-from-the-fec-over-stormy-daniels-payment.html,"This story was published by the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative news organization in Washington, D.C.                  Based on what President Donald Trump hears on television about the Federal Election Commission, the nation’s cable news consumer-in-chief must be panicked.                          Day after day, TV talkers squawk about how the independent government agency is poised to pounce. Their contention: A $130,000 hush-money payment in October 2016 from Trump lawyer Michael Cohen to porn actress and alleged Trump paramour Stormy Daniels could constitute an illegal in-kind campaign contribution to Trump’s presidential campaign—one that exceeds federal limits ($2,700 per election) and wasn’t properly disclosed.                          CNN legal analyst Joey Jackson expects a robust FEC inquiry. “You know, they’re certainly in charge—the regulatory body,” he said.                          Fox News political analyst Juan Williams predicted an FEC investigation will loom over Trump like a cloud. “It matters in terms of whether there was a Federal Election commission violation—that matters because that will drag out the story and keep it alive,” he warned.                          “They’re worried about a Federal Election Commission violation,” CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said of Trump’s legal team. “I think they’re setting themselves up to defend against an FEC claim.”                          Trump, however, has little cause to fear the FEC anytime soon, even if the agency, created by Congress in response to Watergate, is empowered to enforce federal campaign finance laws.                          Here’s why.                          On Jan. 22, campaign finance reform organization Common Cause filed a complaint against Trump and Trump’s presidential campaign, accusing them of violating federal election law in relation to the Daniels payment.                          Don’t be shocked if the FEC doesn’t rule on the complaint until after the 2020 presidential election, when it’s conceivable Trump is no longer president.                          Statistics provided by FEC Commissioner Steven Walther indicated that the agency, as of Sept. 30, had 20 unresolved complaints more than two years old on its books. Of those, 11 were more than three years old.                          One extreme example of FEC justice delayed involves a September 2009 complaint of allegedly illegal campaign contributions to then-Sen. Harry Reid, D–Nevada. Only in December 2015—more than six years later—did the commission close the complaint file following a mixed ruling. Were the FEC to take as much time deliberating on the Common Cause complaint as they did on the Reid campaign contribution complaint, they’d rule on it in April 2024.                          And earlier this month, in a ruling seven-plus years in the making, a federal judge concluded the FEC acted “contrary to law” by dismissing a Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington complaint concerning how conservative nonprofit American Action Network disclosed election season advertisements ahead of the 2010 midterm election. The FEC must now comply with the ruling.                          Any FEC complaint is subject to at least several steps that together usually take several months.                          They include the agency notifying accused parties and offering the accused time to respond to accusations. Supplemental filings by the accuser and accused may further delay matters.                          That’s all before the FEC’s general counsel’s office, which hasn’t had a permanent head since Anthony Herman resigned in July 2013, crafts and presents commissioners with a formal investigative report—a process that ranges from weeks to, in rare cases, more than two years.                          Commissioners themselves are known to wait months or even years more before conducting a vote. Delays may be prompted by any of several factors—competing commission priorities, a parallel investigation by the Department of Justice or commissioner putting an informal, temporary “hold” on a particular case.                          The FEC does not comment on pending investigations, the details of which aren’t released publicly until after a behind-closed-doors vote.                          Chairwoman Caroline Hunter said Monday that the FEC complaint process generally “takes some time, and we want to give everybody an opportunity to respond. It really depends on each case how long it will take.” The FEC reviews each complaint it receives and investigates those that meet basic criteria set forth in agency’s complaint guidebook.                          Common Cause’s Stephen Spaulding, who earlier this decade worked as special counsel to former Democratic commissioner Ann Ravel, expects his organization’s complaint will move slowly.                          “It is very easy for commissioners to filibuster behind closed doors and delay any serious enforcement efforts because every single stage of an investigation requires four affirmative votes,” he said.                          There’s little expectation among more than a dozen campaign finance lawyers and former commissioners interviewed this week by the Center for Public Integrity that the FEC will ever agree that Trump, or his campaign, violated a campaign finance law in connection with the Daniels payment.                          “It’s hard to see why any candidate who is familiar with the last decade’s worth of FEC inaction would be concerned about FEC enforcement,” said Adav Noti, chief of staff for nonpartisan campaign reform group Campaign Legal Center, who until last year served as the FEC’s associate general counsel for policy.                          It’s not usually the political affiliation of the accused that drives whether the FEC penalizes somebody, but how legal questions in a given case “fit commissioners’ established views,” said Daniel Petalas, the FEC’s former acting general counsel and current principal at law firm Garvey Schubert Barer.                          “And as they have all held their seats for a very long time, those views are fairly hardened now and consistent across cases,” Petalas said.                          Ellen Weintraub, the FEC’s vice chairwoman and a Democrat, blames her Republican counterparts for what she says is “obstruction.” While FEC commissioners of late have rarely agreed on much of anything, commissioners used to share an understanding, on a bipartisan basis, that investigations should be conducted “when there were credible allegations that the law had been broken,” Weintraub said.                          In recent years, Republicans often engage in “procedural maneuvers to slow down decision-making and have been largely unwilling to conduct investigations,” she added.                          Hunter rejects the notion that the FEC’s four commissioners—one Democrat, one independent and two Republicans—are incapable of finding common ground.                          “We find four votes on the vast majority” of cases, she said.                          Hunter acknowledged that high-profile FEC cases do, however, often end with commissioners disagreeing, which she attributes to “different philosophies on the reach of the law.”                          Since 2016, the FEC has either deadlocked on, dismissed or closed without action several complaints against Trump or his related committees. One case involved a fundraising letter disclaimer. Another involved a television ad disclaimer. A third argued Trump’s inaugural committee broke federal law by how it disclosed its donors.                          The most high profile of the lot accused Trump of failing to properly disclose payments to actors his campaign hired to attend his presidential announcement rally.                          Two former FEC leaders offered dim views of the FEC aggressively pursuing the Trump–Daniels matter, albeit for different reasons.                          Former FEC Chairman Bradley Smith, a Republican who now leads the nonprofit Institute for Free Speech, says that while the FEC’s role is to investigate credible complaints, there may be little for the FEC to investigate as it relates to Trump and Daniels.                          That, he says, is because Trump has a long history of paying for people’s silence and the Daniels payment didn’t directly fund a campaign activity, such as get-out-the-vote efforts or campaign committee overhead.                          Ravel, herself a former FEC chairwoman, disagrees that there’s nothing for the FEC to investigate—there’s plenty, she says.                          “But with the way the commission is now, the likelihood of them really even investigating it is pretty slim,” Ravel said.                          While the FEC is a six-member bipartisan body, only four commissioners are currently serving. The other two commissioner slots are vacant: Democrat Ann Ravel resigned in March 2017 and Republican Lee Goodman resigned in February.                          The only man who can nominate their replacements is Trump himself. To date, he has not, and he’s under no obligation to do so. Trump, meanwhile, is guided in this realm by White House counsel Don McGahn, himself a former FEC chairman who has long advocated for deregulating the nation’s campaign finance system.                          There are two practical implications to consider.                          First, four FEC commissioners must vote to advance any agency investigations or penalize scofflaw political committees. That means the four remaining FEC commissioners must unanimously agree on how to move forward on any given matter.                          Second, were any of the four remaining commissioners to resign or find themselves unable to attend commission meetings—illness, unexpected travel—the FEC would lack a quorum, and therefore, be prevented from conducting high-level business.                          The White House did not respond to Center for Public Integrity questions about the FEC or when Trump will nominate new commissioners. Trump in September did nominate Texas lawyer Trey Trainor, a Republican and Trump campaign supporter, to replace current Commissioner Matthew Petersen, a Republican. Petersen, like his three FEC colleagues, continues to serve on the FEC despite his six-year term having expired earlier this decade.                          But six months on, the U.S. Senate, which must confirm FEC nominees, has not even scheduled Trainor’s confirmation hearing, to say nothing of voting on his nomination.                          The FEC is a law enforcement agency, but a civil law enforcement agency. It doles out penalties in the form of fines and, secondarily, public shame.                          Trump is a billionaire who could pay any FEC fine—almost all fall within the four- to five-figure range—with what for him amounts to pocket change.                          And a notable apology from October 2016 notwithstanding, Trump doesn’t shame easily.                          The White House denies Trump had an affair with Daniels, who on Sunday detailed to 60 Minutes correspondent Anderson Cooper her alleged sexual encounter with Trump and acceptance of $130,000 to keep quiet—for a while—about it.                          And if nonstop headlines about Trump’s alleged infidelities, ever-changing policy positions and litany of patently false statements aren’t enough to cow him, how could an FEC general counsel’s report possibly injure his reputation?                          The Department of Justice, to which Common Cause also complained in January, could potentially cause Trump more trouble than the FEC over the Stormy Daniels payment, as it has authority to criminally investigate “knowing and willful” violations of federal campaign finance laws.                          It was the Department of Justice, not the FEC, that played the lead role in pursuing former Sen. John Edwards, D–North Carolina, for allegedly accepting illegal campaign contributions in a bid to conceal an affair with his 2008 presidential campaign videographer Rielle Hunter, with whom he had a baby. (Edwards’ federal trial ended in a hung jury, and federal prosecutors did not attempt to retry him.)                          Special counsel Robert Mueller could also investigate the payment to Daniels as part of his sweeping investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 election, although there’s no indication that he has or will.                          Say the FEC did fine Trump.                          There’s the very real possibility he’d simply ignore it.                          The Center for Public Integrity in October found more than 160 examples of political candidates and committees never paying fines the FEC levied on them.                          In almost all cases, the federal government did little to collect the fines or otherwise pursue the matters.

b'It\xe2\x80\x99s Time to Stop Yammering About Liberal Bias',https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/03/there-really-are-plenty-of-conservative-columnists.html,"                  We’re now several days into a roiling debate over whether liberals ought to be upset that the Atlantic hired a man who once argued that a quarter of American women should be executed. Predictably, both sides have progressed from that specific and tedious subject to a debate about liberal bias in media, broadly speaking, of which the backlash against Kevin Williamson’s hiring is supposedly proof. “This is not about persuasion or engagement; it never is,” National Review contributor Dan McLaughlin tweeted. “It’s about using anger and organization to shout down, defund, and drive out opposing viewpoints.” The Washington Examiner’s Tim Carney moaned: “They always pretend there’s an acceptable conservative somewhere. ‘Oh, just not Douthat.’ ‘Just not McArdle.’ ‘Anyone but Stephens.’ ‘Williamson is literally the worst they could’ve picked.’ Murray, Shapiro, et cetera, et cetera.’ ”                          This is all nonsense. Tablet’s Yair Rosenberg challenged progressive followers to recommend right-wing writers “about whom you would not be offended if they were hired by the NY Times/Atlantic/Washington Post/etc?” You would not know reading this question or the griping from Carney, McLaughlin, and all the others that before Williamson, those three publications already employed, by my cursory and possibly incomplete count, 18 conservatives and libertarians writing regularly for them: David Brooks, Bret Stephens, Bari Weiss, Ross Douthat, David Frum, Conor Friedersdorf, Reihan Salam, George Will, Charles Krauthammer, Megan McArdle, Marc Thiessen, Max Boot, Michael Gerson, Jennifer Rubin, Kathleen Parker, Radley Balko, Ed Rogers, and Anne Applebaum. The majority offer their takes frequently and freely without liberals on Twitter or anywhere else jeering in mass protest. None would raise more than a few grumbles if lateral moves were made between those publications—if the Atlantic hired Max Boot, say, or if Kathleen Parker went to the Times.                          Individual liberals and leftists will differ on which voices in conservative media they think should be added to that roster, but generally speaking, the majority of that list suggests the left is almost entirely indifferent to establishment conservatives and libertarians writing for centrist and center-left publications, so long as those conservatives aren’t overly caustic or trollish. As much as some junior staffer at the Washington Free Beacon might want to believe he’d be martyred by a social media mob if he were picked up by the Washington Post, no one, in all likelihood, would bat an eye.                          Rosenberg’s question also presumes there is a need to have more conservative writers represented at those publications in the first place. This is not at all obvious given the lack of representation the Times, the Post, and the Atlantic have collectively afforded to people elsewhere on the political spectrum. There is, by my count, exactly one writer at the three, the Post’s Elizabeth Bruenig, who identifies as a socialist. Heaven and earth will pass away before an anarchist is a columnist at the New York Times. And if there really is a representative need to have more conservative writers brought on, it doesn’t follow that there is a need for writers who, like Williamson, have been highly critical of Donald Trump and the current state of the right, as very nearly all of those writers have been. The anti-Trump constituency of the Republican Party is a tiny minority of voters and an even more negligible proportion of the adult population. It is patently absurd that more than a dozen writers can regularly be expected to advocate on their behalf in three of America’s most respected and widely read outlets for opinion journalism.                          This entire conversation is getting a little old—more than half a century old if we’re counting. Over the course of this 1966 episode of his show Firing Line, William F. Buckley, founder of National Review and contemporary American conservative movement broadly speaking, deploys just about every trope imaginable about liberal bias—not just in the press, but on campus and in concerns about extremism.                          “The final problem really is whether a society can express itself democratically in any reliable way if the prevailing bias prevents it from the opportunity sufficiently to evaluate contrary ideas and contrary opinions,” Buckley says about midway through. At one point, his guest, the liberal talk show host David Susskind, suggests the topic of supposed liberal indoctrination on college campuses had been wrung dry since the publication in 1951 of God & Man at Yale, a book that recommended the banning of textbooks and firing of professors accused of committing transgressions against the doctrines of Christianity and capitalism.                          Now, think about this for a minute. In 1951, the nation was in the throes of a second Red Scare, a moral panic that saw leftists and imagined leftists across America thrown out of their jobs, and professorships, and friend circles, and the good graces of polite society. Additionally, America was, obviously, vastly more socially conservative than it is today, so much so that conservatives today herald the mores of that time as values we should return to. And yet, even back then, conservatives insisted they were being persecuted.                          This raises a few obvious questions that are, for whatever reason, rarely asked. If American institutions really were intolerably liberal in 1951 and in 1966, then what would a state of affairs that satisfied the conservative movement actually look like? If, as conservatives have insisted over decades of uninterrupted complaint, the American people really are being indoctrinated into liberalism in their formative years at our schools and colleges and in their adult years by an oppressively slanted press, how exactly does one explain the American political situation in 2018, with right-wing control of the presidency, the House, the Senate, the Supreme Court, 33 governorships, and 32 state legislatures? If America’s citizenry really has been spoon-fed leftist propaganda for nearly 70 straight years, isn’t the reorganization of the United States into semiautonomous workers’ republics long overdue?                          Moreover, if institutional bias is a problem for American society, then why haven’t conservatives tried to solve it by building alternative unbiased institutions? The obvious societal corrective for bias at the Times and the Post and other outlets would be starting publications with a real claim to neutrality. Instead, conservatives have founded a constellation of explicitly partisan outlets ranging from National Review to the Gateway Pundit. The obvious societal corrective for bias at CNN and the major networks would be a truly objective news channel. Instead, we have Fox News. The obvious corrective for bias, indoctrination, and intolerance at our universities would be supporting and sending young people to colleges that strenuously avoid endorsing particular viewpoints. Instead, conservatives give money and often send their kids to explicitly conservative institutions such as Hillsdale, Liberty, Bob Jones, and dozens of other colleges that, mysteriously, never seem to come up in screeds about political correctness and the need to expose students to ideas they disagree with.                          If we really ought to be troubled that there aren’t enough neutral purveyors of information in American society, the conservative efforts to address the issue amount, plainly, to moral failure. The notion that liberals should welcome Kevin Williamson into the fold without complaint even as the publication he’s left, to my knowledge, employs not a single liberal or leftist on its staff for regular commentary is laughable. Until the Daily Caller hires a full-time writer who regularly makes the case for taking Marx and microaggressions seriously, the right’s complaints on this subject should be dismissed out of hand and without regret. If that puts those in liberal media out of touch with the right in America, so be it. That would leave us, anyway, a step above Williamson and his anti-Trump defenders—themselves out of touch with the entirety of the left, the vast majority on the right and, of course, reality.

b'Why Didn\xe2\x80\x99t Trump Just Take the Border Wall Deal?',https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/03/trump-should-have-accepted-democrats-border-wall-offer.html,"                  On Saturday night, Ann Coulter, furious over President Donald Trump’s inability to build a massive wall along our Southern border, offered an idea to Fox News’ Jeanine Pirro, one of Trump’s favorite television hosts. “It’s his authority under the Constitution that cannot be taken away from him by any legislature, by any court … to defend our borders,” Coulter said. “I think it can be done right on our border as part of the defense.”                          In other words, Coulter was suggesting that Trump use the surge of military funding included in last week’s omnibus bill to construct the wall. “Have the Seabees do it,” Coulter said.                          Early the following morning, Trump, who has been known to watch Fox on DVR, tweeted that “because our Military is again rich,” the government should “build WALL through M!” As the Washington Post reported, in one of the more delightfully dry sentences of late, “Two advisers said ‘M’ stood for ‘military.’ ”                          There are many reasons why this is unlikely to happen. There’s no clear authorization to use Defense Department monies in this way. There would be litigation. Also, the Defense Department does not want to do this, at all. All Democrats and many Republicans in Congress, too, would not be down with repurposing money for “rebuilding our military” to a make-work monument to political malinvestment on the border. Trump is mad that he didn’t secure his wall in the omnibus, and so he’s throwing out silly ideas and wasting West Wing man-hours by forcing his aides to look into them as though he’s onto something.                          If only there had been some viable path recently toward construction of the wall. Rather than spending spring break stewing in the White House over what might have been, Trump could be lounging in a lawn chair by the border right now, sipping iced tea, watching as contractors erect the prototypical barrier of his liking. He could have fulfilled one of his core campaign promises to his base, a promise that not any generic Republican president would have prioritized.                          And all he had to do was accept a 10- to 14-year path to citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants brought to the United States at a young age.                          That deal has been on the table for more than a month now: Trump gives Democrats a path to citizenship for 1.8 million Dreamers; Democrats give Trump his full $25 billion wall funding request. The Trump administration balked at this clean trade when the Senate was negotiating immigration in February and again in the weeks before the omnibus. The master dealer always wanted something more, be it sharp cuts to family-based immigration or enhanced interior enforcement. Democrats were willing to blow money on Trump’s vanity project, handing him a political victory, but they were never going to secure Dreamers’ future by agreeing to the sharpest tightening of legal immigration levels in decades or selling out other undocumented immigrants.                          It is confounding that Trump didn’t just take the deal. Yes, he may have gotten some heat from Breitbart over the “amnesty,” but no one reads Breitbart anymore. They would have gotten over it. And in return, he would have been able to build the wall of his dreams! He could spend the next few years bragging endlessly about how he was able to secure this project in spite of what had appeared to be unwavering Democratic resistance. (Oh, how Trump would have enjoyed the Democratic infighting.) Had he taken the deal, he could have even said—and for the first time in his political career, somewhat accurately—that he had shrewdly negotiated a deal. He took the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program hostage, forcing Democrats to give him his wall. Inhumane? Yes. Successful? Absolutely.                          Trump could try again in the late-September funding bill, but the calendar will be far too close to the midterms for any substantial bipartisan deal to take place. He could issue a veto threat, but shutting down the government over a border wall five weeks before voters go to the polls, in a cycle that already has Republicans on defense might not fare well for his party. After that, Republicans will either have a slimmer majority in the House or Democrats will have a majority. Neither eases the prospects for large border wall appropriations in the future. Perhaps Trump will have another shot if the courts allow his rescinding of DACA to stand, and Democrats come back to the table.                          Trump, as the Post reported, has been “privately grousing that his political supporters could become disenchanted without progress” on the wall. In that case, he should have enchanted them with progress last week.

b'The Real Romney',https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/03/mitt-romneys-hard-line-on-immigration-helped-pave-the-way-for-donald-trump.html,"                  Mitt Romney is the heavy favorite to replace Orrin Hatch in the Senate. But he still has to win a Republican primary. And even in Utah, where Romney is treated as royalty, this means proving his conservative bona fides.                          “For instance, I’m a deficit hawk,” Romney assured a group of Republican women on Monday. “That makes me more conservative than a lot of Republicans and a lot of Democrats. I’m also more of a hawk on immigration than even the president. My view was these DACA kids shouldn’t all be allowed to stay in the country legally.” He continued: “Now I will accept the president’s view on this, but for me, I draw the line and say, those who’ve come illegally should not be given a special path to citizenship.”                          It’s tempting to treat this as simple pandering: another example of Mitt Romney saying whatever it takes to win support from conservative voters. This is, after all, the same Mitt Romney who embraced mandatory health coverage as governor of Massachusetts, before disavowing it on the campaign trail. And the same Romney whose vocal criticism of Donald Trump didn’t stop him from auditioning to be secretary of state. But far from opportunistic, Romney’s hard line against DACA recipients reflects one of his true, long-standing political commitments. On most issues, the former Massachusetts governor may have been unconvincing as a “severely conservative” Republican, but on immigration, he appears to be a sincere hawk.                          Romney emphasized his opposition to “illegal immigration” during his 2008 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. “As governor, I authorized the state police to enforce immigration laws. I opposed driver’s licenses and in-state tuition for illegal aliens,” he said in a campaign advertisement, contrasting his positions with those of “Hillary Clinton and the Democrats.” “As president, I’ll oppose amnesty, cut funding for sanctuary cities, and secure our borders,” Romney said.                          This position placed Romney to the right of the Republican mainstream. But he was in line with the GOP base. While he would lose the nomination to John McCain—a moderate on immigration—this hard-line position would redound to Romney’s benefit during the 2012 Republican primary, when he faced a formidable opponent in then–Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who entered the race as the avatar for the Tea Party’s anti-Washington fervor of the moment. Romney was the front-runner, but he also had a record of moderation in Massachusetts, and Perry loomed as a serious threat to his right.                          There was just one place where Romney could outflank him: immigration. And he did exactly that, blasting Perry’s support of in-state tuition for undocumented students at Texas colleges and accusing Perry of creating a “magnet” for illegal immigrants. “That shouldn’t be allowed,” said Romney. “It makes no sense at all.” This led Perry to the reply that would fatally weaken his candidacy. “If you say we should not educate children who come into our state … by no fault of their own, I don’t think you have a heart.”                          By that standard, Romney was happy to be heartless. At a GOP debate in South Carolina, he announced his opposition to the DREAM Act that was then being considered by Congress. “I’ve indicated I would veto the DREAM Act if provisions included in that act say that people who were here illegally—if they go to school here long enough, if they get a degree here—then they can become permanent residents,” he said. “I think we have to follow the law and insist that those that have come here illegally return home and apply—get in line with everyone else.” Romney infamously declared he was for “self-deportation” during a Republican debate in Florida, advocating a strategy of attrition, in which the United States would make life so difficult that immigrants leave of their own volition.                          Romney’s position on immigration was so right-wing that, in its post-election autopsy of his defeat, the Republican National Committee urged future nominees to reject his approach entirely, warning of electoral irrelevance if the Republican Party cannot attract votes from Hispanic and Asian American communities.                          Of course, Donald Trump won the party’s nomination, and the White House, by doing just the opposite, attacking immigrants (and other minorities) in harsh, racist terms. And while most of the Republican Party still refrains from using Trump’s language, it is fully on board with the president’s draconian immigration policies. But Romney was there first, urging a similarly uncompromising approach on immigration, indulging nativist impulse among Republican voters.                          Romney’s history on immigration is one reason why we should not treat Trump as an aberration from the Republican Party but the outgrowth—and perhaps the apotheosis—of forces that have driven Republican politics for at least a decade. Romney’s hostility to illegal immigration helped him win the Republican nomination. What’s more, he gave tacit approval to Donald Trump’s birtherism, even welcoming his endorsement in 2012. After he lost, Romney attributed Obama’s re-election to a promise of “gifts” to black people, women, and the “children of illegals.”                          Romney holds sincere, conservative views on immigration, but he also helped give rise to the divisive politics that he now criticizes in Trump. Romney indulged the worst impulses of the Republican base, feeding it an appetizer of racial resentment and leaving it hungry for someone who could offer a feast.
